    <h1>Overflow Narrative Report – Saturday, May 17 (SAT17)</h1>

    <h2>Track Catch Interpretation</h2>
    <p>Overflow sessions on Saturday were most frequently associated with tracks such as 'Psychopharmacology & Depressive Disorders', 'Neuropsychiatry', and 'Academic Psychiatry'. This suggests a strong early interest in biologically rooted and evidence-driven frameworks that promise rapid clinical application. Sessions that also touched on ethics and global issues indicated a hunger for broader systemic impact.</p>

    <h2>Keyword Catch Insights</h2>
    <p>Frequent session keywords included: Neuropsychiatry, Lifestyle Psychiatry and Medicine, Treatment (other non-pharmacological), Physician Well-Being and Burnout, Wellness, Women's Health, and others. These point to a pattern of high audience interest in physician wellness, neuropsychiatry, AI integration in psychiatry, and lifestyle-related innovations.</p>

    <h2>Description Catch Patterns</h2>
    <p>Session descriptions often highlighted applied tools and trends, such as: “Catatonia is a severe neuropsychiatric disorder associated with significant morbidity and mortality...”, “Introduction: Insomnia and mental illness share a bidirectional relationship, along with a multidirectional relationship with the other five lifestyle tenets as they relate to sleep and psychiatric diseases...”, and “Optimal clinical care includes not only understanding what is the patient’s illness but also who is the person with the illness...”. These indicate early audience gravitation toward practical strategies for patient care, technology ethics, and clinician support systems.</p>

    <h2>Inference Summary</h2>
    <p>On Saturday, overflow was most acute for sessions that bridged traditional psychiatric treatments with broader socio-clinical relevance. Sessions on neuropsychiatric disorders, emerging pharmacological interventions, and socially embedded care models—particularly those addressing workforce wellness and ethics—captured disproportionate attention. Attendees also demonstrated strong interest in applied technology (AI in psychiatry), health policy, and the future of psychiatric education.</p>
