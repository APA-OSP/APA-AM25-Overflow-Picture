After being included under criteria for schizophrenia in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, its recognition was limited for much of the latter half of the 20th century. More recently, evidence has increasingly shown that catatonia can present in a wide range of psychiatric, neurological, and systemic medical conditions. Our session will briefly review this history, before actively involving participants in learning to recognize and treat different presentations of catatonia. We will supplement informational slides with real-time multiple choice questions. Then our presenters will contribute to the broadening understanding of the range of underlying conditions that can present with catatonia, by reviewing the association between catatonia and specific medical illnesses and substance use-related conditions. Participants will be introduced to specific cases of catatonia associated with medical illness, neuropsychiatric conditions, and substance misuse. Finally, presenters will review the overall evidence on management of catatonia, before opening the session for discussion and questions. The chair and speakers in this session will include four consultation-liaison psychiatrists who work in both inpatient and outpatient settings and have expertise in catatonia, substance use disorders, and psychiatric education.", "Overflow %": 207.1}, {"Day": "SAT17", "Start Time": "08:00:00", "Title": "Clinical Pearls on Incorporating Positive Sleep Lifestyle in Conceptualizing and Managing Psychiatric Disorders", "Track Catch": "Clinical Updates , Lifestyle Psychiatry and Medicine , Sleep-Wake Disorders", "Keyword Catch": "Lifestyle Psychiatry and Medicine", "Description Catch": "Introduction: Insomnia and mental illness share a bidirectional relationship, along with a multidirectional relationship with the other five lifestyle tenets as they relate to sleep and psychiatric diseases. Besides insomnia being one of the diagnostic criteria for many DSM-5 disorders, it has also been implicated as a causal factor in most psychiatric illnesses1. A CDC survey shows that about one-third of adults sleep poorly. Here, we share a brief overview of sleep disturbance mechanisms and lifestyle, psychopharmacological, and evidence-based psychotherapeutic interventions to restore sleep among people living with mental illness. The session is a part of the APA Presidential Workgroup on Lifestyle Psychiatry, focused on creating educational content for the day-to-day implementation of lifestyle tenets in managing psychiatric disorders. Session Description: Speaker One will discuss the prevalence of sleep disruption and disorders in common psychiatric conditions, including schizophrenia and related disorders, bipolar disorder, major depression, and anxiety and trauma disorders. They will also explore the interplay of complex hormonal, homeostatic, and neurobiological processes influencing sleep. Speaker Two will discuss the nature of the relationship between sleep impairment and common psychiatric disorders, including causative and predictive roles and role as a risk factor for relapse. Up to 80% of remitted patients with psychotic and bipolar disorders complain of sleep3. Speaker Three will explore the overlapping symptoms and shared presentation of various sleep and psychiatric disorders and their relationship with psychiatric medications. Speaker Four will discuss the effects of poor sleep on cognition, a domain often affected in most psychiatric diagnoses. Sleep affects treatment outcomes, adherence, and functional abilities. Improper sleep might contribute to the 10\u201315-year reduction in patients' life expectancy4. Sleep impairment can be a prodromal symptom of psychosis and also worsening psychotic symptoms later in the course of the disorder. Improving sleep quality can lead to better outcomes in mental health, as shown in a meta-analysis5. Speaker Five will discuss the scope of the assessment of quality and sleep continuity, duration, and initiation parameters. They will explore the tools used in daily practice to evaluate and manage sleep impairment in clinical settings as an early intervention. Relevance: Currently, there is a lack of consistent use of clinical guidelines for evaluation, management, and evidence-based treatment approaches in managing sleep interruptions and disorders in the psychiatric population. To conclude, the speaker panel will discuss positive lifestyle strategies using various methods like mindfulness-based stress reduction, nutrition, and physical activities to promote sleep, prevent psychiatric symptoms from worsening and relapsing and improve outcomes.", "Overflow %": 188.5}, {"Day": "SAT17", "Start Time": "08:00:00", "Title": "Clinical Education on the Social Determinants of Mental Health: Putting the Social Back Into the Biopsychosocial Model - Vestermark Psychiatry Education Award", "Track Catch": "Treatment (other non-pharmacological) , Other disorders and foci of clinical attention", "Keyword Catch": "Treatment (other non-pharmacological)", "Description Catch": "Optimal clinical care includes not only understanding what is the patient\u2019s illness but also who is the person with the illness. While this approach to evaluation and treatment has been known for centuries, its importance in education and clinical practice has waxed and waned over the last hundred years in the US. The clinical value of this framework for evaluation was embodied in the DSM IV multiaxial assessment in Axis IV, which addressed the environmental and social factors that influence mental health, the social determinants of mental health (SDOMH) which are essentially identical to the social determinants of health (SDOH). The multiaxial system was never successfully implemented into psychiatric assessment in part because of time constraints determined by insurance reimbursement for evaluation, and was eliminated in DSM V. Another important influence on the demise of Axis IV was the rise of research in the neuroscientific basis of psychiatric illnesses starting in the second half of the 20th century with the concomitant developments in psychopharmacological and other somatic treatments. In contrast, the United Nations, in developing its 2030 Sustainable Development Goals, and the World Health Organization and the US CDC, in their elaboration of specific social determinants of health, and their potential adverse effects on health and mental health, played a key role in bringing back this critically important set of influences to the attention of healthcare practitioners, systems, and organizations for the potential to enhance primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention which could improve clinical outcomes. The APA lagged behind other medical organizations, such as in family practice and pediatrics, in its attention to SDOMH, but in 2021 convened the Presidential Task Force on the Social Determinants of Mental Health. An important issue highlighted in the task force report is the need to transform medical and other clinician education so that learning about SDOMH is viewed as foundational to comprehensive education and clinical practice, and not an optional enhancement. This presentation will review the concepts of SDOMH and the research base supporting this concept, as well as key findings from the APA task force. Clinical illustrations from Dr Tasman\u2019s own teaching , supervision, and clinical practice will help illustrate the importance of the education of psychiatric trainees in SDOMH, which includes thorough grounding in both didactic education and the clinical evaluation and treatment process.", "Overflow %": 202.5}, {"Day": "SAT17", "Start Time": "08:00:00", "Title": "Balancing Efficiency and Security: A Comprehensive Look at AI Scribes in Medical Documentation", "Track Catch": "Ethics , Physician Well-Being and Burnout", "Keyword Catch": "Physician Well-Being and Burnout", "Description Catch": "Artificial intelligence (AI) and its use in electronic health record (EHR) documentation is emerging as a trending topic, with a significant spike in literature published in recent years. This growing interest is driven by the potential of AI scribes to address the pervasive issue of documentation burden, a key factor contributing to decreased lifestyle satisfaction and burnout among healthcare professionals. Although research on AI scribing in medicine is growing, studies on AI-assisted documentation in psychiatry are limited. Fortunately, many of the findings are generalizable and applicable to psychiatry. The subset of generative AI most relevant to clinical documentation includes machine learning, deep learning, neural networks, large language models, and natural language processing. AI scribes, or automatic speech recognition technologies, have already been implemented to transcribe speech-to-text in medical documentation to reduce healthcare provider burnout. A higher prevalence of burnout among healthcare professionals is associated with more time spent on the EHR system, often extending outside of the workday, thus resulting in increased \u201cwork outside of work.\u201d The need for EHR documentation is unavoidable. Specific measures can help circumvent this workload on providers, such as using dictation devices, streamlining EHR systems, hiring human scribes, and using AI scribes. The accuracy of AI scribes has improved tremendously, with some automatic transcription services demonstrating nearly identical accuracy rates compared to manual transcription services, which can significantly decrease the costs and time needed for clinical documentation without affecting patient satisfaction, note length, or detail. In psychiatry, the potential reduction in burnout from using AI scribes would allow providers to spend more time on patient-physician interactions, maintaining consistent eye contact and body language and decreasing after-work EHR \u201cpajama time.\u201d The outlook on AI scribes and psychiatry is mixed, but many psychiatrists believe this technology will increase access to care, with almost no chance that AI will replace human empathy. However, implementing AI scribes in actual clinical practice could be difficult for some providers due to the required training and adaptation. Ethical considerations must be considered. The sensitive nature of psychiatric practice raises concerns about data privacy and security. It is crucial to consider the balance between improving clinical lifestyle and maintaining patient confidentiality. Regulatory frameworks for AI scribes are still in their infancy and must be developed to ensure responsible implementation. This comprehensive look at AI scribes in medical documentation explores their potential to improve the clinical lifestyle by reducing documentation burden while examining the crucial considerations for their implementation in healthcare settings, particularly psychiatry.", "Overflow %": 126.8}, {"Day": "SAT17", "Start Time": "08:00:00", "Title": "Positive Psychiatry: A Decade of Progress Meets the Age of Artificial Intelligence", "Track Catch": "Ethics , Wellness , Others (includes Normal Development)", "Keyword Catch": "Wellness", "Description Catch": "During his 2012-2013 APA Presidency, Dr. Dilip Jeste made Positive Psychiatry his Presidential Theme, and initiated a transformative shift in psychiatry, emphasizing not just the treatment of mental illness, but also the enhancement of well-being\u2014a cornerstone of Positive Psychiatry. Coinciding with the release of the DSM-5 in 2013, Dr. Jeste\u2019s vision highlighted the importance of fostering positive traits such as resilience, spirituality, wisdom, and optimism, along with creating supportive environments to improve mental and physical health across the lifespan. Positive Psychiatry extends beyond symptom reduction, focusing on promoting strengths and enhancing quality of life. Social media and the press have significantly contributed to the growth of Positive Psychiatry by raising mental health awareness and spreading messages that encourage the cultivation of positive psychological traits. While these platforms have had adverse effects in some groups, they have largely enabled rapid dissemination of research, success stories, and strategies for improving mental health, providing the public with easier access to tools for well-being. Digital innovation, especially through social media, continues to amplify the impact and global reach of Positive Psychiatry. This session will explore the past decade\u2019s research in Positive Psychiatry, with a focus on its role in improving health outcomes. Attendees will be introduced to the PROGRESS framework, a mnemonic that fosters positive psychological traits to enhance well-being and resilience, underscoring the transformative potential of this approach in clinical and non-clinical settings alike. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning are increasingly being integrated into psychiatric practice, providing personalized treatment, enhancing well-being, and identifying key patterns in patient data. These advancements open new pathways for fostering resilience and tracking progress, positioning AI as a critical element in the future of Positive Psychiatry. Looking ahead, Positive Psychiatry will leverage AI, social media, and collaborative models to broaden access to care and promote health equity. The future of the field will focus on holistic approaches, incorporating digital tools to cultivate positive psychological traits and improve mental health outcomes on a larger scale. The symposium will offer interactive components such as panel discussion and Q&A session, encouraging active engagement between speakers and participants. Attendees will have opportunities to collaborate, share insights, and discuss practical applications of the latest research and innovations in Positive Psychiatry, contributing to the field\u2019s continued growth.", "Overflow %": 119.6}, {"Day": "SAT17", "Start Time": "08:00:00", "Title": "The Interplay of Gynecologic Disorders and Mental Health Throughout the Lifespan: Important Considerations for Psychiatrists", "Track Catch": "RFM , Women's Health , Depressive Disorders", "Keyword Catch": "Women's Health", "Description Catch": "Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) affects 6-10% of females of reproductive age and is associated with significant psychological distress, depression, and concerns about future health and infertility. Given its prevalence, psychiatrists should be prepared to care for patients with PCOS.  According to the Rotterdam criteria, a diagnosis of PCOS requires two out of three symptoms: oligo/anovulation, hyperandrogenism, or polycystic ovarian morphology on ultrasound. Patients often experience heavy periods, acne, excessive hair growth, weight gain, and infertility. Recent studies indicate an increased risk of mood disorders, anxiety disorders, disordered eating, and sexual dysfunction in this population; thus, understanding this interplay is crucial for psychiatrists. \nFurthermore, the prevalence of both infertility and cancer is higher in PCOS patients, potentially exacerbating the risk of psychiatric disorders. There is a threefold increased risk of endometrial cancer in PCOS patients, with the odds ratio increasing to 6.0 for those under age 40. In recent years, medical advances have led to improved survival for patients, with a 91% 5-year survival rate for endometrial cancer, making future quality-of-life decisions such as fertility and psychiatric care particularly important.  \nCancer diagnoses and treatments are closely linked to mental health considerations. Obtaining a  \ncancer diagnosis impacts mood and anxiety disorders, and symptoms of severe mental illness may delay or interrupt time-sensitive cancer treatments. Furthermore, once in treatment, patients may experience increased stress from repeated tests and surgical intervention. Additionally, some cancer drugs impact antidepressant selection due to pharmacokinetic interactions.  \nIt is essential to consider how treatments for gynecologic and breast cancers affect fertility and to raise awareness about the emerging field of onco-fertility. In the final section of our talk, we will address onco-fertility from a psychiatric perspective. Although current data on the relationship between assisted reproduction techniques and resulting anxiety or depression are inconsistent, recent research suggests this relationship may be bidirectional. We will explore this interplay, present the evidence base, and share resources for patients and physicians to learn more about this growing field. \nOverall, we will use a case study to integrate these three important topics: PCOS, gynecologic cancers, and onco-fertility. We will summarize data on the interplay of psychiatric conditions and treatments for PCOS, malignancy, and infertility, and discuss inter-specialty collaboration in care for these patients. We will engage the audience with interactive small groups throughout the presentation to practice discussing these conditions with patients, to increase comfort and efficacy in treating these patients. By the end of the session, participants will be aware of tangible steps they can take to enact change.", "Overflow %": 116.1}, {"Day": "SAT17", "Start Time": "08:00:00", "Title": "Lifestyle Change: Re-Turn-Ing to Nature and Forest for Mental Wellbeing", "Track Catch": "Clinical Updates , Lifestyle Psychiatry and Medicine", "Keyword Catch": "Lifestyle Psychiatry and Medicine", "Description Catch": "Nature plays a predominant role in the lives of individuals, societies and civilizations.

With effective and early treatment, persons living with HIV (PLWH) have a life expectancy similar to that of the general population, and medication regimens are simpler and better tolerated. However, despite all these advancements, providing care for people living with HIV still involves various challenges that can affect treatment outcomes and quality of life. In this symposium, four experienced HIV psychiatrists will discuss topics with clinical relevance for everyday practice, including neuropsychiatric side effects of antiretrovirals, potential drug-drug interactions, assessment and treatment of anxiety disorders, stigma and inequalities in HIV infection, pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for HIV infection, and post-exposure prophylaxis (doxyPEP) for sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Current antiretroviral regimens used for the treatment of HIV infection are now simpler and better tolerated. However, they still have important drug interactions with psychiatric medications. Furthermore, first-line antiretrovirals can cause neuropsychiatric side effects that can be difficult to differentiate from primary psychiatric disorders. Studies that included a diagnostic interview report a prevalence of anxiety disorders in PLWH of 23%. Specific anxiety disorders include the following: panic disorder (10% in PWH), generalized anxiety disorder (5.6% in PWH), and social anxiety disorder (9% in PWH). Anxiety is associated with significant disability and poorer HIV treatment outcomes. Moreover, anxiety disorders are often associated with substance use behavior in PLWH. In view of the high prevalence of anxiety in PLWH, it is recommended to screen all persons with HIV at each routine clinic visit, especially in populations at particularly high risk: history of anxiety disorders in the family, anxious personality, alcohol excess, as part of the investigation of cognitive impairment, and in the presence of multiple stressful life events. Treatments for anxiety will also be reviewed. Pre-exposure prophylaxis for HIV infection (PrEP) was first approved by the FDA in 2012 and has been shown to significantly decrease the transmission of HIV. There are currently three available options for PrEP, two of them in the form of a tablet and the most recent one as a long-acting injectable. Adherence to daily or on-demand pills has historically been challenging, and cabotegravir, which is administered as an injection every 8 weeks, has been shown to be more effective than TDF/FTC for HIV prevention. Research has indicated that doxycycline can be effective as post-exposure prophylaxis for preventing STIs, particularly syphilis and chlamydia, in high-risk populations. However, there are still concerns regarding the potential development of antibiotic resistance and its decreased effectiveness in the prevention of gonorrhea.

The first presentation will be by Dr Julian Beezhold and describes the history of the European Psychiatric Association and how it developed. Founded in 1983 as the Association of European Psychiatrists comprising mainly French and German academic psychiatrists, it initially conducted its business in French. Soon it grew to include psychiatrists from across Europe and adopted English as its official language. A name change to the European Psychiatric Association (EPA) followed to broaden its appeal. Then followed a lengthy period of negotiation to reconfigure from individuals only to an Association that now includes 44 National Psychiatric Associations from across Europe as members. Today the EPA represents about 80 000 psychiatrists from every country across Europe. The second presentation will be by Dr Jan Wise and will examine the use of rating scales across multiple languages and cultures - raising the question of whether we end up measuring and understanding the same things.

Individuals with developmental delays disproportionately use emergency psychiatric services compared to neurotypical peers. Unfortunately, these patients face extended boarding times in emergency departments (EDs) due to a scarcity of acute psychiatric units tailored to their needs. An observational study analyzing ED visits of children with autism across a 9-month period found that the median length of stay in the ED for patients with psychiatric chief complaints versus other chief complaints was 3.0 versus 1.2 days. Prolonged boarding in the ED delays necessary inpatient psychiatric care and places them in environments ill-equipped to address their complex needs. These patients often have extended lengths of stay in the emergency department, and long stays in these ill-equipped environments can contribute to adverse events including self-harming behaviors, frequent use of emergency medications, and the use of restraints. General psychiatric units decline admission for these patients due to concern for their ability to provide the appropriate care for the patient. DDMI units, which can provide the necessary care, require approval from authorizing agencies. Therefore, patients frequently end up boarding in the ED for multiple days before returning to their previous residence to wait for a bed to open at the DDMI unit. This clear gap in our healthcare system needs to be addressed as providing psychiatric care for these patients in the ED is a disservice to both our patients and staff. To address these challenges, it is crucial to develop accommodations that minimize risks during extended ED boarding. Suggested measures include policy adjustments in psychiatric EDs, including allowing personal belongings under family supervision. An understanding of what safe accommodations can be implemented in emergency settings is essential for improving care for this vulnerable population. In this session, we will discuss the cases of two patients with non-verbal autism who experienced significant challenges in accessing appropriate inpatient psychiatric care. We will have small group sessions devoted to discussing limitations of caring for this population in an emergency setting and what adverse events patients have experienced due to prolonged boarding. We will discuss the availability of DDMI units for this population, using Orange County as an example, and review the resources and accommodations available provided in these specialized units. Lastly, we will brainstorm in small groups what policy adjustments and accommodations can be implemented in emergency care settings to appropriately care for this population.", "Overflow %": 87.5}, {"Day": "SAT17", "Start Time": "08:00:00", "Title": "Field-Based Mental Health Teams: Utilizing Street Psychiatry for Holistic Lifestyle Transformations", "Track Catch": "Clinical Updates , Psychiatric Rehabilitation and Recovery", "Keyword Catch": "Psychiatric Rehabilitation and Recovery", "Description Catch": "Homelessness, especially when fueled by untreated mental illness, establishes a lifestyle with increased exposure to disease agents, overcrowding, unsanitary conditions, poor nutrition, weather extremes, trauma, and sleep deprivation. Individuals diagnosed with severe disorders such as schizophrenia or bipolar disorder are especially vulnerable. The population thus has higher rates of chronic health conditions with the average age of death estimated to be between 40-50 years of age. Lifestyle modifications are thus a critical component in preventing morbidity and mortality. For this population, the approach to lifestyle modifications must include outreach, treatment, and rapid housing. Housing is a key element as it provides the psychosocial foundation needed to sustain any intervention. However, accessing housing resources may not be possible without individuals first developing trust with providers and accepting sufficient treatment to address the underlying mental health impairments. \n\nOur session will introduce participants to field-based mental health teams. These teams are designed to meet the needs unhoused individuals by supporting lifestyle modifications directly on the street through a multidisciplinary team-based approach. Participants will become familiar with street psychiatry as an emerging subspecialty in field-based care that serves unhoused individuals residing on the street or other places not intended for human habitation. The psychiatrists in these teams must be culturally and structurally competent and develop treatment plans that are compatible with the harsh realities faced by unhoused individuals. While the overall goal of street psychiatry is to address treatment and housing needs, the immediate focus is to build a meaningful doctor-patient relationship. The session will review an innovative model of field-based mental health care and illustrate how multidisciplinary expertise is leveraged to implement complex lifestyle modifications.\n\nMonitoring for acute needs is a vital component of field-based management. The session will highlight when field-based lifestyle interventions must be paused to pursue inpatient stabilization. Strategies for integrating acute care with field-based services will be discussed. Participants will learn about the challenges involved with field-based lifestyle interventions and how effective system navigation and robust clinical partnerships across all levels of care can overcome barriers. A novel approach to maintaining lifestyle modifications for unhoused individuals who enter the criminal justice system will also be reviewed. Despite extensive effort, a small percentage of the population served may not respond to field-based management.

For both conditions, current treatments are limited in their safety and efficacy. The presentation will highlight novel mechanisms that may help to address efficacy gaps. Dr. Krystal will begin by focusing on the rapid-acting NMDA glutamate receptor antagonist antidepressants, ketamine and S-ketamine. They are more effective than standard medications and non-inferior to ECT for reducing treatment-resistant symptoms and preventing relapse. Three effects of ketamine may contribute to its efficacy: 1) restoration of glutamate synaptic efficacy, 2) regrowth of lost synapses, and 3) anti-inflammatory effects. Ketamine may achieve these effects via transiently activating cortical networks (non-homeostatic neuroplasticity) and preventing the overstimulation of NMDA glutamate receptors (homeostatic neuroplasticity). His presentation will then review other new antidepressants that target these forms of neuroplasticity including classical psychedelic drugs like psilocybin; MDMA, Kv7 agonism, and 5HT1A agonism. Lastly, he will highlight anti-anhedonic and broader antidepressant effects of kappa opioid receptor antagonists. Dr. Marder will describe new approaches for treating psychosis that do rely on antagonizing dopamine. Until this year, all of the available antipsychotic medications treated illness such as schizophrenia by this mechanism. This mechanism is associated with a substantial side effect burden including neurological, endocrine, and metabolic effects. In addition, a substantial proportion of patients are treatment resistant. The mechanisms that will be described affect the excitability of dopamine neurons but not block the receptors. Approaches that will be described include muscarinic agonists, positive allosteric modulators of muscarinic receptors, agonists at trace amine receptors (TAAR1), modulators of glutamate, antagonists of PDE10, and drugs that act on serotonin and sigma receptors. Detailed information about the clinical characteristics of drugs will be described with a focus on the efficacy and side effects of the combination medication, xanomeline-trospium which is currently available.

These individuals have a distinct set of experiences, shaped by their parents' profession. Their upbringing may involve early exposure to psychological concepts, a heightened awareness of mental health, skillfulness in emotional expression and understanding others, as well as facing particular pressures. The interplay of their parents\u2019 professional roles and personal lives creates a distinctive environment that this session aims to explore.\n\nThe original \"Children of Psychiatrists\" session was created by Drs. Leah Dickstein and Michelle Riba, and it has continuously attracted a large and eager audience, often standing-room only. Before the pandemic, the session celebrated its milestone 20th anniversary. We successfully revived the session at the 2024 APA Annual Meeting in New York, where once again, over 200 attendees filled the room, and the session was met with enthusiastic feedback. Combining personal stories and professional insights, this session examines the complex lives of children of psychiatrists. In a time when mental health awareness is becoming more widespread, understanding these unique perspectives is especially important. A key focus of the discussion will be on the protective factors and coping strategies these individuals develop, offering valuable lessons for psychiatrists who are parents. This can inform how they approach supporting their own children while balancing the demands of their profession.\n\nThis session is interactive, featuring a diverse panel of speakers from different age groups and backgrounds. It involves active audience participation through Q&A and panel discussions. Attendees will gain a deeper appreciation of both the challenges and rewards experienced by children in these families. The insights shared will equip psychiatrists with strategies to nurture positive relationships with their children while managing the pressures of their careers.\n\nChildren of Psychiatrists 2025: Stories Beyond the Couch provides a fresh perspective in the mental health conversation, shining a light on the often-overlooked experiences of psychiatrists' children.

Apps, wearables, virtual reality, electronic medical records, telepsychiatry and artificial intelligence are just some examples of how ubiquitous digital tools have become. Smartphones offer a new window into human behavior with digital phenotyping, with tools being created that would allow physicians to use smartphone data on sleep, physical activity, text behaviors or location to predict behavior. As adoption of these tools is growing faster than research into their clinical efficacy and safety, clinicians are seeking guidance on how to approach using digital technology with patients. Psychiatrists need to be able to stay informed of new technological advancements and understand new clinical research methods to be able to incorporate this knowledge into clinical decision making. Without a basic understanding of digital tools, clinicians could inadvertently do harm by recommending a tool that puts patients at risk, or lose out on recommending a tool that may benefit a patient greatly. It is our view that digital psychiatry is a crucial aspect of medical education and needs to be incorporated into medical student, resident and continuing education curricula. This session will touch on different frameworks for creating digital psychiatry curriculums as well as some of the main topics a curriculum should include. The workshop will begin with an overview of digital psychiatry. We will review the currently available resources for continuing medical education for professionals on topics from app evaluation to machine learning. We will then highlight examples of psychiatry departments and programs that have created digital psychiatry curricula. We posit that a structured digital psychiatry curriculum should include the ability to: 1) Define Digital Mental Health (DMH) and common categories of DMH tools, 2) Survey a patient\u2019s digital health preparedness, 3) Use and recommend DMH tools in a clinically useful manner, 4) Understand the elements of formally prescribing DMH applications, 5) Provide opportunities to practice with tools, and 6) Increase awareness of digital mental health tools and their application in clinical care at the institution.

Asian Americans are extremely heterogeneous, comprising 16 racial/ethnic groups with populations over 100,000, resulting in diverse mental health practices and management approaches.\n\nPrevious research has identified broad cultural considerations when approaching Asian patients in mental health care. These include the importance of family dynamics in collectivist cultures, the significant role of stigma as a barrier to seeking mental health treatment, and the relevance of herbal, holistic, or other traditional treatment approaches. Acculturation stress also plays a crucial role in psychopathology. Recent studies have found that second-generation Asian Americans exhibit higher rates of mood disorders and substance abuse compared to their first- or third-generation counterparts, suggesting that intergenerational cultural stress may contribute significantly to mental health outcomes. While these generalized considerations provide a foundation, there is a pressing need for more tailored guidance on mental health approaches for distinct Asian American subgroups.\n\nIn March 2024, the U.S. federal government mandated the disaggregation of Asian American data collection. While this policy change is crucial for better representation of the diverse characteristics of Asian American subgroups, disaggregated clinical considerations in healthcare remain underdeveloped.

Initially conceptualized as a response to chronic workplace stress, burnout is now recognized as a systemic problem deeply embedded within many healthcare institutions. Contributing factors include heavy workloads, long hours, emotional demands of patient care, and a stressful, unsupportive work environment. However, we now recognize that leadership and organizational management are also significant contributing factors. These conditions lead to a progressive disillusionment with the healthcare profession, resulting in not only individual suffering (physical and psychological) but also diminished quality of care. As burnout spreads, what was once seen as individual failure to cope has evolved into a metaphorical \"arson\" culture. In this scenario, systemic neglect and mismanagement within the workplace culture are seen as actively fueling the conditions for burnout, rather than merely failing to prevent it. The term \"arson\" describes what many see as deliberate or reckless disregard for the well-being of healthcare workers, where the institution\u2019s demands continuously \"ignite\" stressors that are not adequately addressed.

When discussing the opioid epidemic, there were an estimated 81,083 overdose deaths in 2023 involving opioids, a 3.68% decrease from 2022 [1]. Many patients with opioid use disorder (OUD) are seen in the emergency department (ED) setting and in 2016 there were 183,147 ED visits for unintentional opioid poisoning, a 30.7% increase from the year prior. A previous study demonstrated that patients with OUD treated in the ED for non-fatal overdose had a 5% one-year mortality with 20% of deaths occurring within 1 month of discharge. The elevated mortality in these patients has made the ED an important site for interventions. Prior studies have demonstrated that initiating buprenorphine in the ED leads to nearly twice the rate of engagement in outpatient treatment after 1 month when compared to referrals alone. Standardizing, implementing, and scaling ED interventions may play a key role in stemming the tide of the opioid epidemic. The NY MATTERS program was an initiative in New York State to assist ED providers in screening for OUD and initiating Buprenorphine as well as connecting patients to continued outpatient care. The program has shown benefits in referral to services. However, studies are limited on the screening and initiation of Buprenorphine in Comprehensive Psychiatric Emergency Rooms (CPEPs). Given the volume of substance use and substance use disorders assessed in psychiatric emergency rooms, CPEPs could be an opportune setting for similar initiatives to promote buprenorphine induction. In October 2023, our hospital system started a system wide initiative for screening and initiation of Buprenorphine in psychiatric emergency rooms. This was marked by a training initiative, followed by mandatory OUD screening for all patients with the option of inducing buprenorphine if the patient was amenable to this.

Although the medical culture is not as buttoned up as in the old days, it remains conservative and reserved, steeped in a persona of professionalism and image. Even with diversity when we celebrate representation of race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, and more, we still use restraint and put our best foot forward. Physicians in leadership, given their influence and visibility, feel especially hamstrung. In this session, we will examine this phenomenon. The chair and first speaker, Michael Myers, MD is a psychiatrist, author, and specialist in physician health. He will briefly summarize the history of psychiatric lived experience in doctors, from the late 19th century up to the present day. Grounded in stigma, much of this is ugly and mean-spirited. Thanks to a few courageous pioneer physicians, their compassionate allies, and progressive initiatives in select medical institutions and associations, it is safer today for physicians living with a psychiatric illness to speak openly and live with authenticity. The next speaker, Jessica \u201cJessi\u201d Gold, MD, MS is a psychiatrist, chief wellness officer, media advocate, and book author, who will discuss how sharing her own experiences with burnout and medications has informed her work with healthcare worker patients clinically and her administrative work more broadly. She will focus on medical culture and the power of our stories to change it. The third speaker, Chase Anderson, MD, MS is an early career child and adolescent psychiatrist who is Black and queer and lives with a history of depression, anxiety, and two suicide attempts when he was younger. He will share his personal experiences of being minoritized in medicine, how discrimination has impacted his mental health, and how he survived. They will focus on how rediscovering his authentic self in medicine, on social media, and being open about his mental health has changed his life in beautiful ways. The fourth speaker, Devika Bhushan, MD is a pediatrician, former acting state surgeon general, chief medical officer at a youth mental health startup, and first-generation immigrant.

This shift in DSM-5 emphasizes that the severity of IDD is now determined by AB reflecting functional skills necessary for daily living and social integration determining the need for level of supports. A \"tripartite model\" of AB further highlights three core skill domains: Conceptual, such as language, reading, writing, and math; Social, including interpersonal communication, social responsibility, gullibility, and rule-following; and Practical, covering personal care, use of money, and transportation. The \"IQ-equivalence\" of AB recognizes that AB deficits can be as disabling as low IQ scores. Impairments in social intelligence and gullibility significantly increase susceptibility to exploitation and legal challenges, underscoring the importance of AB-focused assessments in such settings. Integrating AB into diagnostic frameworks ensures a holistic perspective, providing a more accurate understanding of IDD. DSM-5\u2019s reconceptualization of IDD as a neurodevelopmental disorder, first proposed by the WHO Expert Review Group's \"content model\" integrates IF and AB as dynamic, modifiable constructs. It complements social inclusion, cultural sensitivity, human rights, as well as biomedical scientific perspectives. This contrasts with the static IQ framework that historically dominated the field. Despite this paradigmatic advancement, practical challenges persist, particularly the ease of relying on IQ cut-offs compared to nuanced assessment of AB. This presentation will explore these conceptual shifts and their implications for practice, offering strategies to improve knowledge, social distance and stigma in psychiatric care of co-occurring mental disorders, need for targeted interventions to enhance AB and mental health outcomes. The discussion will also critically examine the historical legacy of IDD in American psychiatry, marked by adverse treatments, widespread institutionalization, and exclusion from psychiatric care. These practices, rooted in stigmatizing and reductive views, stand in stark contrast to the modern emphasis on dignity, capability, and lifelong psychiatric support. Designed for general psychiatrists, this session will honor the legacy of Frank Melonascino, providing insights to help attendees engage more directly in the mental health care of individuals with IDD.

While creativity is at the core of disciplines such as music and the visual arts, we can embrace creative approaches in our day-to-day life as we treat patients, teach our trainees, create programs, tackle organizational challenges, and aspire to live with joy, intention, and balance. Creativity entails the ability to produce something novel that may be a valuable contribution to a specific domain, or a solution to an existing problem. In psychiatric care, creativity is present in most forms of psychotherapy including cognitive-behavioral, psychodynamic, and positive psychology approaches. Music and art psychotherapy offer additional, innovative tools to the psychotherapy process and their benefits expand into medical care and wellness practices. Music and music therapy can benefit physiological, cognitive and psychological parameters including vital signs, pain level, sleep quality, motivation, and symptoms of depression, anxiety, and PTSD. Music may activate brain reward pathways, increase dopamine release, and reduce cortisol level. We present a music therapy group intervention with healthcare professionals during the acute phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, which assisted in promoting wellbeing, meaning, and purpose, and in creating connectedness. Similarly, the visual arts and their use in psychotherapy may bring benefits for mood, anxiety, self-exploration, and communication. Visual art interventions can be incorporated in the treatment of depression, anxiety, PTSD, schizophrenia, and neurocognitive disorders, among others. We present an overview of art therapy interventions for different clinical indications. We discuss our experience facilitating art-therapy groups for individuals with persistent and severe major depression, which assisted to promote mindfulness, behavioral activation, and improved self-assessment, among other benefits.

Lamentably, lithium utilization remains low worldwide in part due to clinician fear of adverse effects, especially concerns around lithium\u2019s risk for renal dysfunction. There is, however, hope on the horizon for clinicians that can inform current patient management, and may radically alter the future treatment paradigm by harnessing one of lithium\u2019s core essential mechanisms: inhibition of the kinase GSK3\u00df. This symposium will thus present the modern view of lithium, exploring the clinical evidence for its distinct benefits on mood, cognition and suicidality, the current mechanism underlying lithium related renal dysfunction, and how GSK3\u00df inhibition plays a central role in lithium\u2019s therapeutic profile. Recent research has identified that the crucial downstream effect of potent GSK3\u00df inhibition is to activate collapsin response mediator protein 2 (CRMP2), a protein with a key role in synaptic plasticity. This symposium will review how this new understanding of GSK3\u00df and synaptic plasticity is supporting the development of a new investigational GSK3\u00df inhibitors with the potential to become effective and safer alternatives to lithium and other medications for bipolar disorder. These are exciting times in the world of psychopharmacology, with new investigational molecules providing a glimpse of what the future might hold. Until novel agents are approved that mimic lithium\u2019s mechanism, clinicians must be adept at prescribing lithium. Human and animal research now indicate that lithium\u2019s entry into collecting duct principal cells in the distal nephron is the direct antecedent of renal dysfunction. This symposium will explain how lithium enters these principal cells via the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC), and how lithium\u2019s accumulation in these cells induce polyuria, the earliest manifestation of lithium related renal dysfunction. One important goal of this session is to demystify lithium\u2019s journey through the kidney, to provide clinicians with a practical polyuria monitoring scheme, and to explain why the ENaC inhibitor amiloride (a potassium sparing diuretic) is the most evidence-based strategy to manage polyuria. For now, lithium remains the best mood stabilizer for patients with a mania history. By appreciating the role of ENaC in its renal effects, clinicians are better able to offer their patients the advantages of lithium until newer agents are approved that might offer another option to harness lithium\u2019s core mechanism.", "Overflow %": 91.6}, {"Day": "SUN18", "Start Time": "08:00:00", "Title": "Beyond the Impasse: A Psychodynamic Perspective on the 'Difficult' Patient", "Track Catch": "Psychotherapy", "Keyword Catch": "Psychotherapy", "Description Catch": "Some wonder whether psychoanalysis and a psychodynamic perspective remain relevant in psychiatry.

The presentation reviews competition between biomedical and biopsychosocial models of psychiatry, suggesting that evidence from neuroscience and genomic research better supports the use of a biopsychosocial rather than a biomedical model. The presentation demonstrates how failure to attend adequately to biopsychosocial and psychodynamic issues contributes to the experience of patients as \u201cdifficult\u201d and to the phenomenon of treatment resistance, especially in patients with significant childhood adversity and personality disorders. It then uses jargon-free language to review and illuminate concepts from psychoanalysis that are relevant to biopsychosocial, psychodynamic engagement of those patients we experience as \u201cdifficult\u201d or presenting with treatment resistant disorders. These concepts include a psychodynamic perspective on the therapeutic alliance, the uses and pitfalls of transference and countertransference, and problems that are likely to arise in work with patients with immature defenses and/or trauma histories. \n\nAdditionally, the presentation will also introduce a psychodynamic approach to psychopharmacology, emphasizing the importance of considering the unconscious meanings patients attach to medications, as well as the transference-countertransference dynamics that can influence treatment adherence and effectiveness.

This session is designed to provide information on managing some common ones: The use of artificial intelligence (AI); The curbside consult; Personality Disordered patients; and patients with overvalued beliefs. AI is a powerful tool with much promise. In medicine, including psychiatry, there are potential pitfalls to AI. These include that the results of an AI search depend on the quality of information the system was trained on. If the information fed into the system is biased or incomplete the results could also be biased or limited. Due to the \u201cblack box\u201d nature of the system the user cannot tell if the result is biased.

These include (among others): Understanding whether a patient relationship has been formed which could create legal liability; The proper documentation of the consult to allow a proper defense if something goes wrong; Recognizing that consultants in this situation may receive limited information which inadvertently affects their assessment; Recognizing that the more specific the advice given the greater risk of liability; and Failure to recognize the difference between a curbside consult and a formal consult. The session will address these issues and possible approaches to them. There are serious forensic issues that are amplified when dealing with patients with personality disorders. These include: suicide risk; non-suicidal self-injury; allegations of abandonment; boundary violations; use of medication in personality disorder patients: and questions about the appropriateness of hospitalization. The presentation will discuss managing these aspects with a focus on psychotherapeutic techniques.

Furthermore, psychotherapy supervisors serve as key role models for their supervisees, helping to consolidate supervisees\u2019 identities as psychotherapists. However, residency training programs often have difficulty identifying psychotherapy supervisors who can meet their training needs. One reason may be that psychiatrists who practice psychotherapy, especially early and mid-career psychiatrists, feel intimidated to self-identify as a psychotherapy supervisor; they may worry they lack the so-called \u201cwisdom\u201d of a former, esteemed supervisor, or feel daunted by their lack of an internalized supervisory role model.

Emotional responses to the climate crisis can impact well-being and contribute to maladaptive behaviors. Green spaces play a crucial role in mitigating these effects by reducing the heat index, improving air quality, and enhancing mental health. Importantly, research supports the correlation between green space exposure and lower incidence of anxiety and depression as well as eco-anxiety, an increasing concern among youth grappling with climate change realities. By providing accessible natural environments, green spaces offer a practical and effective way to address climate change distress and promote community resilience. These areas not only mitigate the physical impacts of climate change but also serve as crucial resources for maintaining mental health in an increasingly challenging environmental landscape.

The first agent, Prozac, has become the symbol for the class, with popular and clinical perceptions ranging from an uncritical acceptance to an uncritical rejection. Acceptance was reflected in the popular reaction to books like Peter Kramer's \"Listening to Prozac\" and Elizabeth Wurtzel's \"Prozac Nation\".

At first glance this list may seem like a dry recitation of what psychiatrists already know. But there is a lot of nuance to be considered. Consider serotonin withdrawal syndrome. How good are the data that guides us? What does it look like? How is it to be distinguished from treatment response? Do we have any idea how frequent it is? What can one do about it? Potential carcinogenicity is a topic that is difficult to study but inappropriate to ignore. What is the evidence for and against such risk? Even sexual side effects, their presence and frequency is far from a mystery. But can it be addressed? How does it interact with other phase of life shifts in sexual interest/capacity - such as adolescence and menopause? Suicidality is controversial. The FDA has published meta-analyzed randomized data raising concerns in young adults and children, but many clinicians reject or oppose that concern. What evidence exists to adjudicate this concern? And if it is a real problem, why does it happen? Withdrawal syndrome, suicidality, sexual side effects, possible medical harms: these are the problems our colleagues face day-to-day.

Long-term increases in synaptic strength are thought to maintain the networks of neurons that store memory. His lab discovered a unique, persistently active protein kinase whose continual enzymatic activity maintains this long-term synaptic enhancement. The enzyme, protein kinase Mzeta (PKMzeta), is a neural-specific isoform of protein kinase C that is necessary and sufficient for sustaining long-term potentiation (LTP), the most widely studied physiological model for the persistent enhancement of synaptic strength.

The Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study (ABCD Study\u00ae) has been following a cohort of nearly 12,000 youth beginning at ages 9-10 into young adulthood, collecting detailed phenotypic, neuroimaging, and genetic data, including measures of parental substance use during pregnancy. Findings from the ABCD Study provide evidence of significant, but modest effects of prenatal cannabis exposure on a variety of outcomes, including brain structure and function, risk of psychopathology, sleep problems, and altered reward sensitivity. However, these findings are based on retrospective data on substance exposure without biological confirmation or data on other environmental exposures during pregnancy. The recently launched HEALthy Brain and Child Development Study (HBCD) will be able to address those limitations. Inspired and guided by the success of the ABCD Study, the HBCD Study was established to recruit a diverse cohort of over 7000 pregnant participants and their children to understand how early life experiences, including prenatal exposure to addictive substances and adverse social environments, can affect neurodevelopmental trajectories and outcomes.

The past decade has seen substantial improvements in access to medication, neuromodulation, psychological and psychosocial services. However, access and the quality of mental health services in community settings continue to be inconsistent and highly variable. There is large variation by psychiatric disorder, treatment and provider. This presentation for the 2025 Senior Scholar Health Services Research Award reviews contributions to psychiatric health services research. There is a focus on the teams that made these contributions, and their findings regarding innovative care models and clinical informatics that support the delivery of high-quality care. The presentation starts with strategies for assessment of access and the quality of mental health services. Assessment of the structure, process and outcomes of care is reviewed, along with findings when these methods are applied to care in the United States. Supports for high quality care are presented, starting with innovative care models. This draws on research that applied collaborative care to populations with serious mental illness and addiction. Researchers studied a primary care medical home that improved the quality of care provided to people with serious mental illness. The effect of this on health equity will be presented. Issues regarding implementation and dissemination of care models such as this will be discussed. Innovative care models now usually include clinical informatics. There will be presentation of innovative clinical informatics systems, including application of state-of-the-art methods such as artificial intelligence. Implementing clinical informatics into care has proven challenging, with limited sustained use and substantial usability concerns. Implementation of innovative health informatics into care for serious mental illness is discussed, drawing on one study that implemented routine patient-reported outcomes and another that implemented computerized services for management of diet, activity and weight. Approaches for addressing challenges related to psychiatric illness and socioeconomic disadvantage will be presented. Next, clinical informatics in the age of Artificial Intelligence will be presented, drawing on research that has used data from mobile devices and machine learning and other analytic approaches. The presentation will conclude with research on methods that have the potential in the future to accurately and feasibly measure the quality of care and support systematic efforts to improve care.

Expanding research on different subgroups and creating policies that address their specific needs are essential for improving mental health care access and quality. Approximately 51.4 million immigrants reside in the U.S., with 41 million children born to foreign-born parents. Of these, 11.7 million are unauthorized immigrants, and 80% are from Latin America. Hispanic immigrants play a crucial role in shaping the nation's socio-economic and cultural fabric._x000D_\n_x000D_\nThe mental health of Hispanic immigrants is influenced by the full scope of their experiences and the contexts in which they live. Adverse experiences, particularly in childhood, heighten the risk of mental health disorders such as depression, PTSD, substance use disorders, and chronic medical conditions. These may result from trauma in their countries of origin, in-transit violence, and events post-resettlement. These exposures are shaped\u2014either negatively or positively\u2014by federal, state, and local policies, including naturalization processes, quotas for protected statuses, increasing detention, and shifts in deportation eligibility. Such policies can worsen existing health disparities, limit access to healthcare, and profoundly affect immigrants' mental health._x000D_\n_x000D_\nStrategies to support the mental health of Hispanic immigrants must consider both material and psychological needs. The resettlement process, often accompanied by instability, can be especially stressful, involving acculturative stress, adaptation to new systems, and precarious housing. Fear of deportation and family separation can be deeply distressing, causing multigenerational emotional trauma. For example, fears related to immigration enforcement can contribute to emotional distress among U.S.-born children of immigrants._x000D_\n_x000D_\nAddressing these challenges requires a comprehensive understanding of the context in which immigrants and families seek and access mental health services. At the family and individual levels, holistic approaches\u2014including culturally relevant tools, community-building initiatives, and collaborations with legal and social organizations\u2014are vital. The speakers will discuss theoretical frameworks for understanding how social and material contexts impact immigrant mental health. They will also explore how this context influences clinical care for immigrant children and families and focus on one example of a community-centered approach: Voices Latinas, a New York City-based non-profit that empowers Hispanic individuals and families by offering services in areas like sexual health, gender-based violence, mental health, and immigration-related issues.", "Overflow %": 118.8}, {"Day": "SUN18", "Start Time": "10:30:00", "Title": "The Role of Photography in Promoting Mental Health Through Lifestyle and Patient Therapy", "Track Catch": "Ethics,Humanities , Lifestyle Psychiatry and Medicine , Other disorders and foci of clinical attention", "Keyword Catch": "Lifestyle Psychiatry and Medicine", "Description Catch": "Photography not only provides a respite and diversion from clinical practice, but it also a tool for understanding and supplementing both self-care and patient care. It promotes a non-verbal means of personal expression as well as an opportunity for creativity not only for the psychiatrist, but also for patients. The value and importance of the arts, including visual arts, and humanities in higher education in Medicine, has been well articulated by the AAMC. This workshop will be divided into three segments. First, we will reflect upon the impact of photography on one psychiatrist\u2019s lifestyle. Second, we will discuss the similarities between photographic terms and psychodynamic theory. Third, we will provide a clinical application. Photography is defined by what is framed and practicing photography can have a calming and containing effect. The photographer must focus on the image he/she wishes to preserve, paying attention to issues such as composition, lighting, color or black and white, and message. Practicing photography in more social situations can provide some distance and protection while allowing one to remain within the group. It allows the photographer to sublimate. Donald Colson noted \u201cIn photography, one \u2018takes\u2019 without depleting, \u2018shoots\u2019 without harming, and indeed, instead of damaging the subject, symbolically preserves it.\u201d Photos can serve as transitional objects and can allow someone to work through their pain and define their \u2018self\u2019. There is overlap between the skills and attitudes of the photographer and that of the psychotherapist focused on depth, insight, and relationships. There are two individuals involved in a photograph, the person taking the image and the person viewing the image. Each viewer brings to the image their own personal history and experiences, a phenomenon similar to that of transference. Both psychotherapy and photography create a situation of being simultaneously deeply engaged and also of holding back in a space of observing rather than experiencing. Similarly, both practice \u201cevenly hovering attention\u201d, allowing the practitioner to see what otherwise might have been missed. Often, what is most interesting is not immediately obvious. In both cases, the key may be found in the little things, or in identifying patterns that become the actual subject of exploration. Sometimes, what transforms the mundane into the meaningful is simply finding a new angle from which to view the subject. In both disciplines, it is necessary to slow things down, either by waiting patiently for the right moment, or by actually slowing down to process to allow something new to be seen. The principles above are apparent in a clinical example that we will share of how photography provides an alternative means for adolescents, initially reluctant to speak, to express their feelings. Having a camera to capture images provides a different vehicle to articulate emotions and augment the therapeutic process.", "Overflow %": 109.4}, {"Day": "SUN18", "Start Time": "10:30:00", "Title": "Ageism: Old Issues.

Elderly individuals are facing concerns that are as problematic as sexism and racism. Only 8.5 percent of people worldwide are aged 65 and over, but this percentage is projected to increase to nearly 17 percent of the world\u2019s population by 2050 and APA has nearly one third of its membership as senior physicians 65 years of age. Additional societal issues have compounded previous concerns and leading to new challenges. The elderly face challenges in the work place and social role based on age alone. Those with advanced age have lower expectations about what they accomplish and face discrimination despite with medical advances and technology age alone is no longer the barrier it once was. Advanced age however can lead to cognitive and physical challenges . Income disparities and resource issues may be exacerbated with age and amplify the disparities associated with race and gender. Loneliness is more likely and can contribute to depression and suicide. Issues such as chronic pain become more prominent and lead to increased risk for substance abuse in the context of treatment program designed primarily for the young. Cognitive impairment can becomes an issue, over diagnosed for some individuals primarily because of their age or underrecognized when interventions can be effective. Attitudinal issues such as ageism impact racial and ethnic minorities more severely. Recent findings show that disorders such as Alzheimer\u2019s is twice as likely in African Americans. This disparity is probably a consequence of poverty, limited medical services, societal stress , and the effects of institutional racism. Racial and ethnic minorities are less likely to be included in clinical trials for interventions treating cognitive impairment.

These lessons are of potential use for others\u2019 developing a framework for assessing research being performed, particularly whether advances proposed are likely to promote further research and have staying power. Lessons are discussed in the context of work done by the awardee, some \u2013 but not all \u2013 of which has been successful. The awardee\u2019s first papers in psychiatry were not in psychopharmacology. Rather, his first paper was a solo author study of the trial of Wilhem Reich, a famous psychiatrist who died while in prison for interstate marketing of his invented orgone boxes. This sad story illustrated the destructiveness of delusions. What is of importance for this award lecture is that it teaches curiosity is needed to be a successful researcher and to pursue interesting scholarly questions. A second lesson is that the times have become much more complicated for changing drug prescribing recommendations. This is indicated in a paper demonstrating the then current aggressive dosing recommendation for maprotiline was producing high blood levels of the drug in patients who developed seizures. We were able to help the manufacturer petition the FDA to redo the dosing regimen. This would likely be more difficult today in a more heavily regulated environment. But it also teaches that translational neuroscience can have effects on making key changes in prescribing. The HPA stress axis has been a focus of drug development with rather poor results. HPA axis function is reviewed as are disorders where there is pronounced overactivity such as MDD with psychotic features. We demonstrated this marked overactivity which has had multiple replications, a lesson learned that properly controlled investigation can stand testing for replication. Mifepristone, a progesterone and cortisol receptor antagonist, was then reported to be rapidly effective in reducing psychotic features, indicating elevated cortisol plays a role in pathogenesis and is not an epiphenomenon. Lesson learned: try to question usual thinking. In Phase III, response was seen primarily in patients who attained blood levels above a so-called therapeutic blood level, somewhat reminiscent of research with maprotiline. Unfortunately, the kinetics of blood levels for the drug plateau at doses beyond those typically studied. Pharmacogenetics have been used as a tool in treating depression, although, the rationale supporting it is thin. Here, there is a need for thinking \u201cout of the box.\u201d For example, short forms of the serotonin transporter promoter are associated with poor response to SSRI\u2019s but our group has demonstrated this poor response actually reflects intolerance to the drugs\u2019 side effects.", "Overflow %": 282.7}, {"Day": "SUN18", "Start Time": "13:30:00", "Title": "OVERFLOW: Spices for Taste and Health", "Track Catch": "Lifestyle Psychiatry and Medicine", "Keyword Catch": "Lifestyle Psychiatry and Medicine", "Description Catch": "Many patients consider taste the limiting factor when adopting a healthy, nutritious diet.

Likewise, in clinical settings the frequency of bipolar misdiagnosis in patients of African ancestry (AA) and the commensurate underutilization of lithium and mood stabilizing anticonvulsants has been observed. Our session will highlight the barriers to research inclusion and biases in clinical practice that persons of AA face when enrolling in genomic studies and while seeking healthcare for bipolar disorder. When comparing diagnoses made in the emergency department as initial point of care, individuals of AA with bipolar disorder are known to have a significantly higher rate of initial diagnosis with schizophrenia than individuals of EA with bipolar disorder.

Positive short-term controlled trial evidence exists for psychological support combined with psilocybin in major depressive disorder (MDD), treatment-resistant depression (TRD), and alcohol use disorder (AUD). In addition, early-phase controlled trial evidence supports the combination of psychological support and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) in AUD and end-of-life-related anxiety and depression. There are more than 75 ongoing studies registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (as of March 2024) that are evaluating the aforementioned and related psychedelics (e.g., N,N-dimethyltryptamine). Ongoing studies are enrolling participants with diagnoses including substance use disorder, tobacco use disorder, anxiety disorders, compulsive and personality disorders, and other mental disorders. Notwithstanding the preliminary evidence for psychedelics in psychiatric disorders, legitimate concerns are raised with respect to the interpretability and translatability of extant controlled studies. For example, there remains a lack of adequate well-controlled short- and long-term studies for most psychedelics. Also, inadequate characterization of safety and abuse liability compromised blinding integrity, and the essentiality of psychotherapy and the \u201cpsychedelic trip\u201d as part of the therapeutic paradigm are unresolved matters, potentially confounding data interpretation and translation. Healthcare providers as well as persons with lived experience require up to date information as it relates to psychedelics broadly and more narrowly on which mental disorders are fit for purpose as candidate targets for psychedelics (if any). Methodological aspects that affect inferences and interpretations of the evidence are absolutely critical so that stakeholders can interpret and generalize the evidence. For example, concerns have been raised to exaggerated claims of efficacy with select psychedelics and understatement of potential safety and tolerability concerns. The degree to which psychedelics are truly innovative and/or are \u201chype\u201d without significant advantages of existing therapeutics requires an imperial and measured discussion.

This gap contributes significantly to years lived with disability. The neuroendocrinology of depression highlights the bidirectional relationship between the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis and depression, although mixed findings exist regarding the clinical impact of subclinical hypothyroidism and thyroid autoimmunity on depression risk and course. While not the primary driver of melancholia, emerging research on hippocampal neurogenesis and CNS injury risk and repair suggests thyroid hormone (TH) may be a \u201crepair cue\u201d in regenerative medicine. To better the clinical research database, it is important to review basics of thyroid metabolism. T4 is a pro-hormone released by the thyroid gland and converted to metabolically active T3 by thyroid deiodinase type I (DI01) in the periphery and deiodinase type II (DI02) in the central nervous system. These deiodinases also clear metabolites such as reverse triiodothyronine (rT3) which has been associated with depression. We will review the potential of TSH and specific iodothyronines as prognostic biomarkers for treatment response or relapse risk at different stages of depression: acute episodes, recovery from an index episode, and long-term prophylaxis or relapse prevention. Thyroid hormone (TH) function and treatment have been widely reviewed, but the evidence is mixed, particularly regarding the use of intrathecal thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) for mood disorders. In clinical practice, TH is used as an accelerating agent (which is generally underutilized, particularly in women), or augmentation strategy at low or supra-physiologic doses. However, the overall evidence base to guide clinicians on specific thyroid hormone selection (T3 vs T4, replacement vs TSH suppression) for depressed patients remains relatively unclear. There is a general clinical practice consensus supporting the use of liothyronine for augmentation of major depression and levothyroxine for bipolar depression; we will discuss whether this dichotomy of T3 vs T4 for unipolar vs bipolar treatment truly exists. Recent advances in genomic medicine, showing how genetic variation in deiodinase activity functionally change serum thyroid parameters, have allowed for pharmacogenomic analyses that may provide clearer clinical guidance on specific thyroid augmentation in depression treatment.

Unlike physical health, where illness typically has its onset during adulthood, 50% of mental illnesses have their onset prior to 14 years of age and 75% by 24 years of age, making these conditions of the young. Despite scientific support for interventions that support health and well-being, and the power of positivity and optimism, these concepts are not routinely valued in clinical practice.

Not only is there a maldistribution of psychiatrists between urban and rural areas of the country, but there is also an actual workforce shortage with estimates between 14,000 and 31,000 more psychiatrists needed nationwide. 20% of America\u2019s population (2020 census) live in rural areas and more than 60% of this subgroup live in designated mental health provider shortage areas.  In Wisconsin, HRSA recently recognized 25 geographic areas as Designated Professional Shortage Areas requiring 67 practitioners needed to remove that designation. Finally, 60% of psychiatrists in this country are 55 years or older. Remedies: There are multiple strategies to address workforce shortages and improve access to mental healthcare. 1) HRSA\u2019s Rural Residency Planning and Development Program Awards has supported the creation of 8 rural psychiatric residencies nationwide. HRSA\u2019s Health Center Planning and Development program has supported community-based organizations such as FQHCs in starting 12 new psychiatry residency programs. ACGME has also recognized the rural workforce shortages and has increased its support of Rural Track programs which combine urban and rural training sites. Some states have increased the number of psychiatry GME positions. Wisconsin\u2019s Department of Health Services helped fund two new rural general psychiatry residencies, graduating a total of 7 new residents a year, increasing the number of state trained psychiatrist by 40% with 60% of the past three year\u2019s graduates having remained in rural communities. Rural training tracts combining both urban and rural locations are an additional approach.  Another GME model are Psychiatry/behavioral health fellowships for primary care physicians to increase their comfort and expertise in treating more routine psychiatric conditions. 2) Consultation programs such as Massachusetts\u2019 and Wisconsin\u2019s Child Psychiatry Consultation Program, can provide telephone support to rural primary care practitioners for child and adolescent psychiatry issues within 30 minutes of a phone call. E-mail consultations are Virginia\u2019s mode of responding to treatment inquiries.

These advocacy methods, showcased by experienced speakers, will provide a foundation for critical analysis and discussion during breakout sessions. The workshop will introduce the idea to reality framework, which is a strategy-building model designed to help participants evaluate key issues and develop actionable advocacy goals. In small groups, participants will collaborate to assess real-world challenges, and using this framework, they will each create at least one measurable advocacy goal that is relevant to their community or practice. These small group sessions are structured to foster creativity, peer learning, and the development of practical, individualized strategies for impactful advocacy. By focusing on actionable steps and fostering peer-to-peer learning, this workshop empowers participants to become effective advocates. Participants can bring back these tangible skills to their own practice, where they can advocate for themselves, their patients and for the field of psychiatry effectively. By the end of the workshop, attendees will have a heightened sense of empowerment, equipped with actionable strategies, and a deeper understanding of how to effect change both nationally and within their local communities. This workshop promises to not only equip participants with advocacy tools but also inspire and energize them to become agents of change.", "Overflow %": 100.0}, {"Day": "MON19", "Start Time": "08:00:00", "Title": "What Every Psychiatrist Should Know About TMS\u00e2\u20ac\u201da Clinical and Research Update", "Track Catch": "Ethics , Somatic Treatments (ECT, rTMS, DBS, etc.) , Depressive Disorders", "Keyword Catch": "Somatic Treatments (ECT, rTMS, DBS, etc.)", "Description Catch": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a non-invasive tool used for treating psychiatric and neurological conditions. The procedure involves using a magnetic coil to deliver repetitive magnetic pulses that target specific areas of the patient\u2019s brain. The targeted area varies depending on the patient\u2019s condition. For instance, patients with treatment-resistant depression are treated at the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, whereas patients with OCD are treated at the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex. In the United States, TMS is FDA-approved for the treatment of major depressive disorder, OCD, nicotine use disorder, and major depressive disorder with anxious distress. However, TMS is also being studied for the management of bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, substance use disorders, and PTSD. TMS has consistently proven effective in managing depressive disorders, with an average response rate of 50% in patients who have not responded to at least one prior psychopharmacological trials. (George et al., 2010) Today, there are different protocols for TMS. In focal or traditional TMS, there are various protocols such as repetitive TMS (rTMS), where patients can be stimulated at low frequency (1 Hz) or high frequency (>5 Hz). (Pascual-Leone et al. 1998) Intermittent Theta Burst Stimulation (iTBS) is a newer protocol that uses bursts of three pulses at high frequency (50 Hz), repeated every 200 ms to mimic the brain\u2019s theta rhythm. This protocol allows the treatment to be delivered in a shorter time (5\u201310 minutes) and has been shown to be equally effective. Continuous Theta Burst Stimulation (cTBS) delivers trains of bursts of three pulses at 50 Hz and is used to inhibit brain regions. This modality mimics the brain Theta waves which are associated with emotional healing, meditation and relaxation. As an alternative to focal TMS, deep or non-focal TMS (dTMS) uses a new H-shaped coil to stimulate different brain structures. In traditional TMS, patients receive one treatment per day for a total of 36 treatments over a period of 7\u20138 weeks. However, more recently, accelerated TMS (aTMS) has been developed, which delivers 50 treatments over a 5-day period. This approach has been shown to treat depression effectively in a very short time frame. TMS is generally well tolerated. The most common side effect is headaches at the treatment site, and the most concerning side effect is seizures related to brain stimulation. However, the risk of seizures is low (0.1-0-6%%) and only occurs during the treatment session. (Rossi et al. 2009) There are few contraindications for TMS, with cochlear implants being the only absolute contraindication due to the potential damage the coil can cause to the implants. Other relative contraindications include pacemakers, history of stroke, seizures, retinal detachment, syncope, traumatic brain injury, severe headaches, or metal implants in the body that are non-MRI compatible.", "Overflow %": 113.8}, {"Day": "MON19", "Start Time": "08:00:00", "Title": "Pharmacologic Approaches to Suicide Prevention in Outpatient Settings", "Track Catch": "ECP , Psychopharmacology", "Keyword Catch": "Psychopharmacology", "Description Catch": "Suicide remains an all too frequent, yet often preventable,  cause of death in the United States and around the world. A host of psychiatric conditions are associated with suicide risk, and accurate diagnosis and prompt treatment of these conditions can be lifesaving. Most individuals who die by suicide have seen a clinician within a relatively short period of time before their death, but few are provided treatment aimed at preventing suicide and fewer still receive what we would consider optimal treatment. Medications often are used to prevent suicide, yet, we have only one FDA approved medication for suicide prevention, Clozaril, which must be given under very special circumstances, and for a relatively few of the \u201cat-risk\u201d population, and is only approved for those with Schizophrenia and Schizoaffective Disorder. This symposium will be focused on the outpatient management of a wide range of psychiatric patients at risk for suicide. It will provide pragmatic guidelines to help mental health clinicians assess and optimally manage suicide risk for several mental conditions treated in ambulatory settings. \n\nOptimal pharmacological management requires a multimodal approach aimed at treating the underlying condition as well as specifically targeting  suicidal thoughts and behaviors.

A core assumption implicitly embedded in most assisted dying policies is that traditionally suicidal individuals, who could otherwise benefit from suicide prevention interventions, are not provided assisted death. Exploring the issue of distinguishing suicidality from assisted dying requests is of increasing importance especially as assisted dying laws expand to include eligibility for more conditions and patient populations. Leaders who have been involved with assisted dying issues in a range of jurisdictions will explore medicolegal, scientific, ethical and public policy issues related to assisted dying, focusing on the literature, experience and processes related to assessing and distinguishing suicidality from assisted dying requests. The session will start with a review of the evidence from jurisdictions providing assisted dying on the basis of a mental disorder and potential tensions, in policy and practice, between allowing psychiatric euthanasia while prohibiting suicide. Next, the panel will review the experience of suicide prevention services following introduction of assisted dying laws, prior to reviewing how assisted dying assessments attempt to distinguish traditional suicidality from other motivations leading to assisted dying requests.

Perinatal individuals may decline antidepressants in the peripartum because of concern about the effects on fetal development in utero or compatibility with breastfeeding (Hippman et al., 2023). Perinatal individuals often express interest in nonpharmacologic or time-limited novel pharmacologic treatments for PMADs. In addition to addressing potential misconceptions regarding the risks and benefits of antidepressants in the peripartum, psychiatrists should be prepared to counsel perinatal individuals on behavioral, digital, neurosteroid, and neural circuit-based therapeutics. Psychiatrists should also be able to differentiate between interventions that do and do not have a meaningful evidence base and safety data in pregnancy. In this session, we will empower clinicians to provide non-pharmacologic and emerging therapeutics for PMADs. We will summarize data on the safety, efficacy, and accessibility of various therapy modalities, community resources, digital interventions and lifestyle modifications. We will address population-specific practical considerations to address when tailoring recommendations for nutrition, exercise, and sleep to perinatal individuals (Leistikow et al., 2022).

The session will focus on both physical activity and healthy diet. Meta-analyses document that the associations of physical activity with beneficial health outcomes begin when adopting very modest amounts of physical activity, that any moderate-to-vigorous physical activity is better than none, and that meeting the national physical activity guidelines reduces mortality and cardiovascular risk substantially. Substantial research also suggests significant mental health benefits from being physically active, even at levels below the public health recommendations. Regarding diet, observational studies and clinical trials alike have demonstrated both association of diet quality with risk of depression and effective treatment of depression with dietary interventions for individuals who have clinical depression and poor baseline diets.

Pharmacogenomics (PGx) is a growing field that offers new insights into precision medicine to support our patient\u2019s active lifestyles. Through the lens of 5 archetypal patients this session discusses how we can identify biologic factors to build a patient centered plan and use PGx to improve patient safety. PGx has come a long way since the human genome was first sequenced in 2001 and is now routinely used in the safe prescribing of medications. To understand PGx and its practice applications, we should reflect on how we conceptualize patients, formalize the heuristics on how we incorporate our observations and evolve our practice patterns. For psychiatrists using biopsychosocial formulations, implementing new observation types into assessments can be daunting; we will discuss ways to formulate PGx data into our overall understanding of our patients, which patients might benefit from these studies and how genetic precision can improve patient outcomes . In this session we will discuss recommendations and indications for CYP testing and how to apply their results in practice. PGx has also made significant strides in identifying new factors in psychiatric illness and predicting potentially life-threatening drug reactions. As an example of novel factors we discuss the methylfolate reductase (MTHFR) gene. Identifying new disease factors, such as these, can significantly change treatment outcomes. PGx also gives insights into specific drug responses and safety, such as GRIK1 to predict topiramate response and HLA sequencing in the prescribing of carbamazepine and oxcarbamazepine.

This session is focused on empowering early-career psychiatrists with the knowledge they need to manage money. In this session, they will receive a comprehensive overview, from budgeting and investing to understanding how their own minds affect how they handle money daily. Participants will initially learn about the differences between their needs and wants through case studies and practical exercises. This skill is fundamental for practical money management. It will help participants reflect on their spending habits and reveal areas of pattern where their spending can be adjusted to achieve their financial goals. After understanding their spending habits, they will learn about different budgeting strategies, such as the 50/30/20 rule. This will extend beyond merely tracking expenses, focusing on how individuals can make informed decisions to achieve financial independence. Next, participants will be equipped with the skills to assess the best investment options for their financial stability. Participants will be introduced to key terms such as risk, return, asset allocation, and diversification, forming the foundation for understanding more complex topics. This foundation will enable participants to grasp the advantages and risks of various investment classes and how these can be incorporated into their own diversified portfolios.

Narrative medicine is now taught in some form at roughly 80 percent of medical schools in the United States. Very simply, narrative medicine pays tribute patients\u2019 stories. It fortifies clinical practice with the ability to recognize, absorb, interpret, and be moved by stories of illness. One of the most significant challenges in medicine is being able to understand that a patient's story is not just a description of symptoms, but an emotional, living narrative that is shared between the patient and clinician \u2013 this is the crux of psychiatric practice. The ultimate goal is for the patient to feel that their story has truly been heard by the physician and for the physician to better understand the patient\u2019s needs. Consequently, the clinical encounter can become more therapeutic and lead to self-reflection and empathy, as well as facilitate better health care, because it restores value to the subjective experience of suffering that is often lost in the objective stance in which clinicians are trained.

These functions are supported by specific circuits in the brain, heavily modulated by the transmitter dopamine. In this lecture I will review the multiple physiological roles of dopamine in the brain, and how these roles are relevant to the clinical symptomatology observed in schizophrenia by converging on the cortico-striato-pallido-thalamo-cortical loops to affect function across multiple domains. Then I will review the evidence for alterations of dopaminergic indices derived from molecular imaging studies, the associated functional correlates, and the potential impact of these functional mechanistic insights on therapeutic developments. Imaging studies with different radiotracers and paradigms have shown that dopamine synthesis and release are enhanced in the striatum, especially the associative striatum, leading to psychosis. This excess in striatal dopamine is associated with an enhanced effect of expectations on auditory perception, leading to biased perception, and auditory hallucinations. Abnormal striatal dopamine is also associated with abnormal functional connectivity between the striatum and the rest of the brain. Unlike the striatum, in extrastriatal regions, including the cortex and the midbrain, dopamine transmission is blunted, leading to deficits in prefrontal cortical function. The disconnection between midbrain and striatal dopamine release in schizophrenia raises the possibility that local influences within the associative striatum from other modulators such as acetylcholine, may lead to the isolated excess in striatal DA release. We examined the distribution of cholinergic terminals in the striatum and did not find any abnormalities, although we did observe a correlation between density of cholinergic innervation in cortex and severity of psychosis and cognitive impairment. We also examined the influence of the opioid receptor system, specifically via the kappa receptors, known to affect both dopamine and D2 receptors, and did not detect abnormal distributions, but more work is needed to have a more comprehensive evaluation. Many unanswered questions remain at this point. The exact cellular mechanisms of the dopamine dysregulation in various brain regions in schizophrenia are unknown. Understanding these mechanisms is critical to developing better therapeutics. One common final pathway is abnormal circuitry that may affect multiple functional domains.

While biological models of mental illness once emphasized \u201cchemical imbalances,\u201d modern perspectives increasingly incorporate an understanding of genetics and epigenetics, neurotransmitters and neuroplasticity, and the functional dynamics of neural circuits. In fact, distinctions between \u201cpsychological\u201d and \u201cbiological\u201d are rapidly fading as evidence demonstrates that effective treatments (whether psychotherapy or pharmacologic agents) alter core brain networks. In addition, an understanding of epigenetics offers novel insights into how social context and environmental factors translate into neurobiological changes at the level of gene expression. Collectively, these advances offer an opportunity to create a new dialogue with our patients, their families, and other health care professionals about the cause and meaning of psychiatric symptoms. They ground psychiatric disorders and associated maladaptive behaviors in the context of a brain disease and away from issues of character and moral fiber that often drive the shame, blame, and stigma many patients face. However, it has been difficult for most psychiatrists to incorporate a neuroscience perspective into their professional identity. Cutting-edge research is often focused on molecular studies or animal models that may seem remote from patient care. Furthermore, articles written by experts are often at a level of complexity that is inaccessible to a clinical audience. The few resources that are available for formal continuing medical education (CME) are often long-form lectures and fail to capitalize on novel active teaching approaches. The NNCI emerged in response to these challenges, with the goal to create, pilot, and disseminate a comprehensive set of shared resources for teaching neuroscience. This library now includes over 200 educational resources, all of which are freely available through the NNCI website (www.NNCIonline.org). Resources are based on principles of adult learning and include a collection of interactive case-based exercises for the classroom as well as self-study. Over the past 10 years, these materials have been used by more than 140,000 individuals from 172 countries.

According to experts, restraint use represents a treatment failure, and there have been many calls to eliminate its use in favor of interventions that better support patients in crisis. It is vital for psychiatric acute care institutions to understand the underlying causes of physical restraint use, learn from evidence-based interventions, and develop innovative alternatives that will reduce and eliminate restraint use. Session participants will discover best practices to minimize or eliminate restraint use. We will examine an evidence-based model called \u201cSix Core Strategies for Reducing Seclusion and Restraint Use\u201d and highlight how the UCLA Resnick Neuropsychiatric Hospital has effectively implemented this systematic framework through an initiative called \u201cRestraint: Opportunities for Avoidance and Reduction (ROAR).\u201d ROAR is the hospital\u2019s five-year goal to eliminate restraint use and achieve greater health equity, using a comprehensive quality improvement strategy.

However, prior to medical training students on average have better health compared to their similarly aged peers. Yet, through training and its rigorous environment, rates of depression, anxiety, and burnout rates increase. Perhaps most concerning, after accidents, suicide is the most common cause of death in medical students and the second most common cause of death in residents overall. Despite this, medical schools and residencies have not been able to fully address concerns and decrease these alarming statistics. Thus, in addition to systemic changes, there is an importance of discussing the long term implications on the physician workforce. The prevalence of mental health demands have increased over the past decade with the COVID-19 pandemic revealing and expanding gaps in care needs. Despite this, nearly all states/territories have a professional shortage of psychiatrists compared to the population. There are systemic challenges to broadening the workforce including differential exposure to the field, stigma, length of training, and limited residency slots due to funding. Unique considerations are1) the effects of lived experience of behavioral health conditions in psychiatry training and 2) the potential vicarious trauma of knowing other physicians with their own behavioral health crises. This presentation will explore practical ways to address behavioral health workforce issues while accounting for the shortage and access needs.

Loneliness affects people of all ages, with around 25% of older adults and 15% of adolescents considered to be suffering from loneliness around the world. Loneliness is associated with oxidative stress, increased inflammation, and structural and functional changes in several brain regions, including the prefrontal, temporal, parietal cortices, limbic system, striatum, and cerebellum. These changes can negatively impact memory and cognition, including social cognition, motivation, emotional regulation, and the neuroendocrine system, leading to increased stress responsivity, negative emotional states, and sensitivity to social threats. These neurobiological changes related to loneliness can adversely impact the health and well-being of individuals as evidenced by the negative association of loneliness with various health outcomes, including depression, anxiety, increased risk of suicide, substance use disorder, cognitive dysfunction, increase in biological markers related to Alzheimer\u2019s disease, cardiovascular disease, stroke, cancer, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Loneliness leads to increased healthcare utilization, poorer quality of life, functional decline, and decreased lifespan. Social factors associated with loneliness include age, lower education, marital status, living arrangements, social support, social activity, disruptive life events, employment, and socioeconomic status. Vulnerable groups, such as young adults, older adults, individuals with disabilities, those with chronic diseases, sexual and gender minorities, migrants, and racial and ethnic minorities, are more susceptible to loneliness. Cultural factors influence loneliness in various societies, with globalization and the increase in migration related to employment, war, and disasters contributing to the rise in loneliness worldwide. Combating loneliness begins with patients' awareness and recognition of the issue. Clinicians, particularly in psychiatry, have the unique opportunity to screen for loneliness, as this is often seen concurrently with mental health conditions.

Increasing workloads, administrative burdens, and emotional distress have led to rising burnout, mental health struggles, and compassion fatigue. This issue affects not only physicians but also the healthcare system as a whole. This work explores physician well-being in the USA, UK, and India, advocating a holistic approach that integrates Lifestyle Medicine, cultural and spiritual considerations, and systemic reforms to create a healthier medical profession.\nCurrent State of Physician Well-being\nPhysician burnout\u2014marked by emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and diminished personal achievement\u2014has reached critical levels worldwide. High rates of depression, anxiety, substance abuse, and suicidal thoughts among doctors highlight the urgency of intervention. Factors contributing to this crisis include:\n\u2022\tAdministrative burdens: Documentation, electronic health records, and regulatory requirements take time away from patient care.\n\u2022\tWorkload and exhaustion: long hours, on-call duties, and sleep deprivation elevate stress levels.\n\u2022\tMedical culture: A stoic, self-reliant mindset discourages physicians from seeking help, reinforcing stigma around mental health.\nThe Promise of Lifestyle Medicine\nLifestyle Medicine provides a structured, evidence-based framework for enhancing physician well-being through six key areas. This presentation will outline specific guidelines for physicians regarding Nutrition, Physical Activity, Restorative Sleep, Stress Management, Avoiding Risky Substances, and Positive Social Connections.  \nCultural beliefs and spiritual perspectives shape physician well-being and influence health-seeking behaviors. Traditional healing practices and spiritual resilience offer valuable coping mechanisms, fostering a sense of purpose and community support.\nSystemic Change: Creating a Culture of Wellness beyond individual efforts, system-wide interventions are crucial for sustained physician well-being:\n\u2022\tReducing Administrative Burdens through streamlined processes and electronic health record optimization.\n\u2022\tPromoting Work-Life Balance via flexible schedules and family support.\n\u2022\tEnhancing Mental Health Access by reducing stigma and ensuring confidential, affordable care.\n\u2022\tFostering a Supportive Environment with open communication and collaborative work culture.\n\u2022\tInvesting in Wellness Programs incorporating Lifestyle Medicine, stress management, and peer support.\nConclusion\nPhysician well-being is essential for a sustainable healthcare system. A comprehensive approach that integrates Lifestyle Medicine, cultural sensitivity, and institutional reforms is necessary.

The Association of Women Psychiatrists (AWP) was founded in 1983 by Alexandra (\u201cAllie\u201d) Symonds along with a small group of other dynamic women psychiatrists. AWP addressed the following needs: (1) national/international mentoring and professional development opportunities for women; (2) the need for supporting and recognizing the accomplishments of women psychiatrists at every level of their careers; (3) the need for leadership opportunities for women; and (4) addressing important health needs for women patients through research, education, and clinical care, informed by gender. Decades later, AWP remains a vibrant and active organization. Its membership is comprised of women psychiatrists at every stage of their careers (medical students, residents/fellows, early/mid/late career psychiatrists, and retired/emeritus professors and psychiatrists) from across the U.S. and abroad. AWP provides annual awards, including the Dickstein medical student award and Symonds resident/fellow award, and the Marian Butterfield award is given to an Early Career psychiatrist. We will review the history of this award, the accomplishments and contributions of Dr. Butterfield, and past recipients. A recipient of this award will discuss the impact this award has had on the trajectory of her career. We also explore the mid-career challenges that women face. In general, there is more support for early career psychiatrists and lacking support for mid-career psychiatrists. Mid-career psychiatrists frequently face increased caregiving burdens in the \u201csandwich generation,\u201d as they sustain growing families while also caring for ageing parents and family members. Women are disproportionally tasked with such responsibilities, which can negatively affect their careers. More support and resources are needed to support women physicians at this stage of their career, to reduce attrition and physician burnout. AWP also supports women with intersectional identities. Discrimination and bias negatively affect women of color, in particular. The ceilings for intersectional groups are particularly hard to break in academic and organizational psychiatry.

Lifetime prevalence estimates are in the range of 8-12% among school age youth and 4-5% in adults, without regard to nationality, race, or socioeconomic status. ADHD is of the most heritable psychiatric disorders. Early neuroimaging studies revealed smaller brain regions and areas of decreased glucose metabolism, as well as delays in cortical maturation. More recent studies have emphasized dysfunctional brain circuitry in attention regulation. Appropriate assessment of ADHD includes use of standardized rating instruments, careful assessment of symptoms, symptom course and related impairments, and a comprehensive medical history. Treatment is likely to include pharmacotherapy and judicious patient-tailored recommendations for behavioral, academic, and occupational interventions. This presentation will summarize ADHD outcomes, proposed etiologies, underlying mechanisms, and approaches to assessment and treatment. Treatment of uncomplicated ADHD and ADHD in the presence of common co-occurring will be discussed, along with strategies for addressing prescription misuse and potential malingering.

Detection of these syndromes, which is often missed by clinicians, has become increasingly important as a consequence of new advances in clinical and biomarker research and the availability of new preventive and treatment interventions. Dementia, once viewed as an entity unto itself, is now understood to represent the final stage of disease processes which can be revealed during a clinically silent, presymptomatic phase or during a mildly symptomatic cognitive or behavioral stage. Etiologic classification, too, has evolved to take into account the presence or absence of biomarkers such as beta amyloid, phosphorylated tau protein or nonspecific neurodegenerative changes which help clinicians to match interventions to the patients most likely to benefit. Recent research into preventive interventions and the recent FDA approval of disease modifying treatments for MCI or early stage Alzheimer\u2019s dementia have increased public interest in early detection and precision medicine approaches. Concurrently, cognitive decline risk factors have been increasingly understood and this has engendered preventive non-pharmacologic programs such as Brain-WISE, developed at Universitiy of Delaware. This symposium will provide Behavioral Health clinicians with an understanding of the evolving syndromal definitions, preventive interventions, biomarker-based detection, and cutting edge treatments.

Adult cannabis use is increasingly widespread, and of cannabis users, 20%-33% develop CUD, highlighting the importance of greater clinician knowledge. This session will address several critical issues by providing up-to-date information that may not be commonly known, including how to diagnose DSM-5 CUD; treatment efficacy for CUD; increasing prevalence of CUD in adults with chronic pain and/or psychiatric disorders; race/ethnic differences in rates of cannabis use and CUD, association of cannabis use with psychotic disorders; efficacy of cannabis for pain and other conditions; placebo-controlled response to laboratory cannabis administration; and genetic influences on CUD. Speakers include two psychiatrists, a neurobiologist and an epidemiologist. First, using DSM-5 criteria to diagnose DSM-5 mild, moderate and severe CUD cases is described. A recent U.S. national survey shows that DSM-5 yields higher prevalences of CUD than DSM-IV, mainly by including mild cases, suggesting that DSM-5 is more sensitive to these cases than DSM-IV. In addition, cannabis use is associated with increased risk for psychotic disorders, but the reasons are unclear. Potential contribution of new cannabis products to this association will be reviewed. Next, evidence for the efficacy of behavioral treatments for CUD will be reviewed, as well as the lack of pharmacological treatments. In addition, differential rates by race/ethnic group will be reviewed, as well as greater increases over time in CUD prevalence among individuals with chronic pain and/or common psychiatric disorders, and possible reasons for these changes. Next, the long-established genetic component of risk for CUD will be reviewed, including heritability estimates of 50-60% as well as contemporary molecular genetics approaches, e.g., genome-wide association studies (GWAS) that examine specific regions and genes associated with CUD. How GWAS findings indicate differences in genetic patterns underlying cannabis use per se and CUD, how we can infer novel causal relationships, and public health implications will be discussed. Finally, laboratory studies modelling key features of CUD (positive subjective effects, self-administration, withdrawal symptoms) and potential cannabis therapeutic effects, particularly reduced pain sensitivity, will be described, as well as placebo-controlled studies showing the intersection of therapeutic and misuse-related cannabis effects. Implications for issues critical to clinical care will be reviewed, including tolerance, consequences of abrupt cannabis cessation on mood, sleep, and pain sensitivity, and advising patients who are considering medical cannabis use.", "Overflow %": 483.3}, {"Day": "TUES20", "Start Time": "13:30:00", "Title": "Psychodermatology: Interface Between Skin and the Mind May Present Opportunities for a More Rewarding Psychiatric Practice", "Track Catch": "Humanities , Collaborative Care , Other disorders and foci of clinical attention", "Keyword Catch": "Collaborative Care", "Description Catch": "Psychodermatology is an underexplored field that may present opportunities to not only help patients but also offer benefits for psychiatrists. Our presentation, chaired by a leader in psychodermatology and one of few in the nation dual certified in both psychiatry and dermatology, offers a way to conceptualize how psychiatric and dermatological conditions interrelate. Psychiatric and dermatologic issues are commonly involved with each other. These skin-mind or mind-skin issues can be categorized amongst the following and more. 1) With regard to the depression and anxiety diagnoses, common chronic skin conditions such as psoriasis, eczema, alopecia areata, etc. are common comorbidities. These psychiatric factors are well established to worsen these physical conditions. Therefore, the negative impact of the mind on the skin or vice versa are not only prevalent but frequently result in a vicious cycle. 2) There are a variety of ways in which patients with psychiatric diagnoses can target and damage their own skin, hair, or nail. These disorders fall under the category of obsessive-compulsive and related disorders, also known as body-focused repetitive behaviors (BFRBs). These include but are not limited to excoriation disorder, trichotillomania, chronic hand dermatitis from repetitive hand washing. The skin checking and picking behavior is also commonly seen in body dysmorphic disorder. 3) There are psychotic conditions such as delusions of parasitosis and Morgellons disorder which are related to the spectrum of psychotic and delusional disorders. We will also discuss diseases such as Darier\u2019s Disease, an autosomal dominant genodermatosis with characteristic skin findings and concomitant psychiatric psychotic and mood disorders, both due to SERCA mutation and disruption in neuronal calcium homeostasis. Patients with Darier\u2019s Disease are at 2.3 times higher risk of being diagnosed with schizophrenia. 4) Cutaneous sensory disorders are when patients experience disturbances in skin sensations (formications) such as burning, crawling, stinging, or itching, without primary skin lesions and with negative medical workup. Compared to delusions of parasitosis, patients may not present as delusional, nevertheless psychopharmacology can be frequently helpful when common dermatologic treatment of steroids and antihistamines are unhelpful. Our session will share the evidence based psychopharmacological and psychotherapeutic treatment of each category. We share treatment approaches both from the psychiatric and dermatological perspective, with the goal of improving interdisciplinary communication and offering our patients well-informed care. Psychodermatology is an unexposed area with unmet needs. This may present opportunities for psychiatrists in multiple ways. 1) The psychiatrist is able to provide much needed help for an underserved patient population. 2) Incorporating psychodermatology can introduce exciting variations in the psychiatric practice.", "Overflow %": 225.0}, {"Day": "TUES20", "Start Time": "13:30:00", "Title": "Suicide Risk in Otherwise Psychiatrically Healthy Individuals: Results From the Laboratory and From the Field", "Track Catch": "Suicide and Risk Evaluation , Neurocognitive Disorders", "Keyword Catch": "Suicide and Risk Evaluation", "Description Catch": "Background Decedents without known mental disorders constitute 5%-40% of suicides and epidemiologic studies show that 20% of those with a history of suicidal behavior (SB) may be free of psychiatric disorders.

Yet, studies of HVs have not focused on the occurrence of SI, nor has SI in HVs been characterized, especially in relation to the occurrence of stress. If SI is not rare in HVs, current approaches to managing suicide risk in medical settings may be too limited to identify psychiatrically healthy individuals at risk for suicide. Aims & Objectives We recruited HVs and major depressive disorder (MDD) patients to test two hypotheses: (1) some HVs, screened to exclude those meeting lifetime criteria for Axis I or II disorders and with no personal or family history of SB, would endorse SI on Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA); and (2) HVs\u2019 SI scores would be lower than those of MDD patients. In addition, we investigated whether HV and MDD groups had different responses to stressors in terms of SI. Method HVs and MDD patients were recruited through advertisements: some patients were recruited in the emergency department. Participants provided 7 days of ecological momentary assessment (EMA) data about SI and stressors.

The 2022 White House Blueprint for Addressing the Maternal Health Crisis identifies improving maternal mental health as a key priority, underscoring the essential role that access to care plays in enhancing perinatal outcomes. Psychiatrists are uniquely positioned to expand access to these crucial services during the perinatal time period.\n\nIn this session, we will convene leading reproductive psychiatrists and researchers from diverse health systems across the United States. We will present evidence-based models for improving access to perinatal mental health care for marginalized and underserved populations, focusing on Black and Latinx individuals, survivors of intimate partner violence, veterans, and individuals with serious mental illness (SMI). We will begin by highlighting the existing disparities in access to care across the perinatal continuum, with a focus on the vital role of psychiatrists. Next, our speakers will present innovative system-level approaches and strategies for increasing access to evidence-based perinatal mental healthcare for marginalized groups. Approaches covered will include Perinatal Psychiatry Access Programs, integrated family mental health services within public systems targeting survivors of intimate partner violence, and preventative perinatal mental health strategies tailored for veterans and people with serious mental illness.\n\nAudience engagement will be fostered through interactive clinical vignettes, followed by a dynamic discussion where participants will brainstorm additional strategies and models to enhance access to perinatal mental healthcare.

During the first half of the presentation, we will examine the importance of cultural identity and social connectiveness in promoting mental health. We will discuss how preserving cultural identity can serve as a protective factor, particularly among immigrants navigating the challenges of balancing multiple cultures. We will also address the effects of marginalization, the experience of being disconnected from both ethnic and mainstream cultures, and the loss of cultural identity on mental health, highlighting its psychological toll.

Strategies include integrating cultural values into treatment plans, fostering inclusive support networks, and providing cultural humility training for mental health professionals. By encouraging community-based activities, peer support, and adapting culturally sensitive interventions, psychiatrists can reduce social isolation and strengthen social connectiveness, leading to improved mental health outcomes in immigrants, as well as their subsequent generations.

As a field, the goal towards precision medicine has been made, but accomplishing this will necessitate pathophysiologic understanding, often through neuroimaging. The goal of this session is to highlight different types of neuroimaging, provide a mechanistic understanding of them and review findings in the field. We will foster a panel discussion in the second half of the time to allow for questions regarding clinical applications of these modalities. Within functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) we will discuss the basics of the imaging modality, the meaning behind default mode network and resting connectivity. We will move on to discuss the novel imaging of the brain functional connectivity networks. Applications of default mode network and resting state functional connectivity to understand the executive control networks in early psychosis before and after treatment with antipsychotics will be discussed.

Dennis Palumbo, MA, MFT, is a therapist by day and novelist by night. His award-winning series of mystery novels features protagonist Dr. Daniel Rinaldi, a psychologist who works with the Pittsburgh Police. Mr. Palumbo was a writer for the popular series Welcome Back Kotter and the WGA-nominated film, My Favorite Year. He was recently Consulting Producer for the Hulu TV series The Patient. Francis Lu, MD, is a psychiatrist who has led dozens of film seminars at the Esalen Institute on positive psychological qualities and character virtues. Susan Hatters Friedman, MD, MSt, is a forensic psychiatrist who also studied crime fiction writing, and who has published creative writing. The session focuses on the depictions of psychiatry in film, positive lessons, and personal narrative about the intersection of film and mental health practice. Psychiatrists are often represented in stereotypical ways in popular film and television, as well as in novels that came before. Psychiatrists have been described as stereotypical Dr. Evils, Dr. Dippys, Dr. Wonderfuls, and Dr. Detached, each with their own issues. Characters often jump to conclusions about diagnosis, and engage in boundary violations that would be problematic in the real world. Psychiatrists may \u2018save the day\u2019 explaining the protagonist\u2019s mental illness, or may be present for titillation, fear-mongering, or comic relief. Portrayals may add to stigma about having a mental illness or seeing a mental health professional, rather than encouraging appropriate diagnosis and treatment. For every Dr. Melfi (Sopranos) or every Dr. Huang (Law & Order), there are dozens of potentially negative portrayals, perhaps most notably Dr. Hannibal Lecter. Dr. Friedman will discuss the characterization of psychiatrists in films and fiction, the good and the bad. An important counterpoint, Dr. Lu will explore the salutary mental health lessons about mindfulness, gratefulness, and resilience, drawn from film. Mindful viewing of films allows for contemplative reflection, an opening of oneself to lessons such as of belonging.

This generalized feeling of Anomie, or fear of social disintegration, can generate a propensity to gravitate towards authoritarianism as a way to restore social order. It can also lead to a tendency towards tribalism, in which the individual seeks out smaller groups with which to identify and which oftentimes are characterized by an attitude of defiance against the mainstream society that they perceive as disintegrating. Psychodynamic concepts such as the function of primary process-thinking and defense mechanisms can help patients recognize and correct faulty thinking. Object Relations Theory can help patients shore up their internal object relations and clarify distorted perceptions of the intentions and motivations of others. Self-Psychology Theory can help patients regulate self-esteem, modulate anxiety and build affect tolerance. A psychiatrist who utilizes psychodynamic principles and provides the patient with support, empathy, understanding and a consistent and healing therapeutic relationship can offer hope and the restoration of trust to persons who are experiencing Anomie and the fear of existential threats. This presentation will also address the goals of psychotherapy which include, 1) developing a capacity to modulate anxiety so that it does not lead to defensive distortions of reality, 2) developing a benevolent conscience that allows for a reasonable pursuit of pleasure without unreasonable guilt, 3) developing a capacity to love without fearing a loss of the self in experiences of fusion, or of excessive anxiety in the face of separations and 4) developing a stable sense of self, all of which can help patients maintain courage and loving connections in the presence of existential threats.", "Overflow %": 131.2}, {"Day": "TUES20", "Start Time": "15:45:00", "Title": "Stories, Self-Disclosure, and Self-Care: The Experience of 3 Psychiatrist Authors", "Track Catch": "Clinical Updates , Physician Well-Being and Burnout", "Keyword Catch": "Physician Well-Being and Burnout", "Description Catch": "Psychiatrists are familiar with and encouraged as a part of our career development to write for academic audiences, but fewer among us recognize the power of writing for general audiences and the unique skills we possess as psychiatrists that allow us to effectively do so.

In KAP, the psychedelic properties of ketamine provide an opportunity to explore a patient\u2019s inner psychology with a therapeutic purpose. As a psychedelic, ketamine induces feelings of calmness, euphoria, peacefulness, and an absence of negativity, while distorting the perception of space and time. In therapy settings, ketamine can expand insight into the world and one\u2019s personal psychology, potentially leading to the disintegration of the self. At moderate doses, individuals may find themselves embedded in dream-like images and spaces. These oneiric images presented by ketamine can be subject to interpretation and analysis by the therapist, aiming for integration of the ketamine experience. In the typical KAP model, the patient receives both a medical and psychiatric evaluation followed by one or two preparatory sessions aimed at educating them on what to expect during a ketamine session. These sessions involve education on ketamine\u2019s benefits, risks, and psychedelic effects. Patients become familiar with traditional concepts of psychedelic psychotherapy such as \"set and setting,\" integration, and preparation for potential challenging moments. KAP sessions typically include one or two therapists and a medical provider who ensure safety, monitor vitals, and facilitate both the session and psychological integration. During the first ketamine session, the therapists welcome the patient and encourage openness to the experience. Relaxation and breathing exercises help to reduce anxiety about the upcoming session. In KAP, eye masks and music can enhance the inward psychological experience. After the ketamine experience, the patient is encouraged to discuss their insights with the therapist. Drawing or journaling may also be used to help the patient integrate their experience. Today, many ketamine clinics do not offer psychotherapy. KAP, however, has been shown to be effective in the management of depression and PTSD. Compared to ketamine treatment alone, KAP adds healing effects facilitated by the psychedelic experience, helping patients navigate their traumatic experiences with an additional layer of psychological support. This can potentially improve patients\u2019 quality of life. Our objective is to educate the audience about the nuts and bolts of KAP, as well as the profile of patients who could benefit from it.

Due to a growing awareness of the neurobiological underpinnings of mental illness, there is increased interest in the research of nutritional supplements as adjunctive treatments for multiple mental health conditions. Numerous studies on supplements such as S-adenosylmethionine (SAM-e), St. Johns Wort, 5-hydroxytroptophan, and methyl folate have shown varying degrees of effectiveness in treating depression and anti-depressant anxiety. Popular supplements such as ashwagandha and inositol have also been researched for their effectiveness in reducing cortisol levels and generalized anxiety.

These rhythms allow animals and humans to anticipate and adapt to predictable environmental changes, such as the day\u2013night cycle, optimizing organ and brain function accordingly.\nCircadian rhythms are driven by a set of core clock genes that operate in a cell-autonomous manner in nearly every organ and brain region. These cellular clocks are hierarchically organized, with the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus serving as the master pacemaker. The SCN synchronizes its timing with environmental light through input from a unique group of intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) that express melanopsin and are most sensitive to cyan-blue light.\nThese ipRGCs also project to other brain regions that regulate sleep, alertness, mood, and pain, including migraine sensitivity. The discovery of ipRGCs has revealed how the timing, duration, wavelength, and intensity of ambient light can be used therapeutically to treat sleep disorders, mood disorders, jet lag, and circadian misalignment from shift work.\n\nCircadian rhythms also regulate neuroendocrine function and coordinate with peripheral clocks in organs such as the liver, heart, and gut to control metabolism and physiological processes.

Methods: Our prospective study, designed to examine the impact of a VR experience on empathy levels among psychiatry residents in a community hospital, utilized the Jefferson Scale of Empathy (JSE). This widely recognized tool is specifically designed to measure empathy within the context of healthcare education and patient interaction. Participants engaged in a 25-minute, award-winning animated VR scenario titled \"Goliath,\" which explored themes of schizophrenia, gaming, and human connection. Following the VR experience, participants were asked to complete a post-intervention survey. Results: We enrolled 26 subjects in age groups 26-50. Pertinent data was collected on demographic characteristics of participants, including age, sex, ethnicity, and post-graduate training year. Pre- and post-intervention data from the Jefferson scale filled by the are currently being analyzed using SPSS. Conclusion: Through this study, we aim to evaluate whether an immersive VR experience can enhance empathy among early career psychiatrists, potentially improving medical training and patient care. Moving forward, we strive to investigate the long-term impact of VR empathy training on clinical practice, explore its use across various specialties, and assess its cost-effectiveness and scalability.", "Overflow %": 114.8}, {"Day": "WED21", "Start Time": "13:30:00", "Title": "A Clinicians Guide to the Management of Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia in the Era of Boxed Warnings", "Track Catch": "Neuropsychiatry , Neurocognitive Disorders", "Keyword Catch": "Neuropsychiatry", "Description Catch": "Dementias are the most common neurodegenerative conditions in human beings. As we age, the incidence and prevalence of dementias increase. Currently in the United States, there are over 5 million individuals with dementias. This number is projected to rise to over 11 million over the next thirty years. Despite emerging data on various important aspects of dementia, the diagnosis and management of these disorders is not standardized. The data on the management dementias is still limited with none of the pharmacotherapeutic agents available in the market showing any longer-term benefits. Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia (BPSD) refers to a group of non-cognitive symptoms and behaviors that occur commonly in patients with dementia. They result from a complex interplay between various biological, psychological and social factors involved in the disease process. BPSD is associated with increased caregiver burden, institutionalization, a more rapid decline in cognition and function and overall poorer quality of life. It also adds to the direct and indirect costs of caring for patients with dementia. Available data indicate efficacy for some non-pharmacological and pharmacological treatment modalities for BPSD. However, recently the use of psychotropic medications for the treatment of BPSD has generated controversy due to increased recognition of their serious adverse effects. In this symposium, we will discuss the epidemiology, neurobiology, assessment and management of individuals with BPSD. We will also provide an evidence-based guideline to assess and manage BPSD. Finally, we will elaborate on the recent controversies in the treatment of individuals with BPSD. This presentation fits nicely into the theme for this year\u2019s conference, medical leadership for mind, brain and body where we will review the latest scientific information on the assessment and management of BPSD.", "Overflow %": 183.0}, {"Day": "WED21", "Start Time": "13:30:00", "Title": "Dynamic Therapy With Self-Destructive Borderline Patients: An Alliance Based Intervention for Suicide", "Track Catch": "Psychotherapy , Personality Disorders", "Keyword Catch": "Psychotherapy", "Description Catch": "In the last 25 years suicide has increased by 30% in the US, while a growing crisis in mental health is recognized in the post-pandemic world. Broadening training of clinicians to treat suicidal patients is an appropriate response. Although several behavioral and psychodynamic therapies have been found to be efficacious in treatment of suicidal and self-destructive borderline patients, few clinicians achieve mastery of even one of these. This workshop presents 9 practical principles helpful in establishing and maintaining a therapeutic alliance in the psychodynamic psychotherapy of self-destructive borderline patients. The approach focuses on the therapeutic alliance, viewing suicide as an interpersonal event with meaning in the therapeutic relationship, and engages the patient\u2019s negative transference as underlying suicidal and some self-destructive behavior. The principles are: (1) differentiate therapy from consultation, (2) differentiate lethal from non-lethal self-destructive behavior, (3) include the patient\u2019s responsibility to stay alive as part of the therapeutic alliance, (4) contain and metabolize the countertransference, (5) engage affect, (6) non-punitively interpret the patient\u2019s aggression in considering ending the therapy through suicide, (7) hold the patient responsible for preservation of the therapy, (8) search for the perceived injury from the therapist that may have precipitated the self-destructive behavior, and (9) provide an opportunity for repair. These principles are noted to be congruent with shared elements identified by an expert consensus panel review of behavioral and psychodynamic therapies for suicidal patients with borderline personality disorder. Case material will be used to illustrate the principles and create a space for highly interactive discussion. Workshop participants will also be encouraged to offer case examples from their own practices.

There are similar concerns with First Responders. This session starts by exploring neural pathways and neuroanatomy to gain a comprehensive understanding of the pathology behind PTSD, anxiety and mood disorders.  This understanding in turn empowers psychiatrist to give effective, de-stigmatizing patient education about the nature of deviations from a state of mental health.\n\nKeeping in the vein of empowering the individual, the session will introduce participants to the associated factors of service culture, cultural conditioning, and service identity that cause significant distress in members of the military and first responder communities. These issues are particularly prominent when transitioning out of service and add to the complexity and seemingly reduce the efficacy of mental health treatments for these populations. This session outlines a transdiagnostic and culturally specific, peer led group program used as a psychoeducation and skills-building program for improved emotional regulation and interpersonal relationships that was evaluated for the Australian Defence and Veteran Suicide Royal Commission in 2023. This program bolsters self-awareness, individual and social functioning, and wellbeing and does so outside of the clinical paradigm. \n\nDue to high dropout rates from PTSD treatment among service members and veterans (upwards of 50%), novel strategies are urgently needed. Unfortunately, the latest 2023 VA/DoD PTSD Clinical Practice Guideline (CPG) significantly reduced the number of recommended treatments (e.g., from 7 to 3 trauma-focused therapies), despite numerous clinical trials of novel approaches since the 2017 guideline. All European versions of trauma-focused therapies were downgraded. The downgrading occurred not because of new evidence but because existing evidence was evaluated differently. Though the process was meant to be more transparent and unbiased methodology, there remain substantial questions suggesting problems with selective interpretation of evidence and unscientific extrapolations from systematic reviews. These problems have far-reaching clinical implications, and call for a more holistic approach to categorizing, prioritizing, and delivering PTSD treatments to military and veteran populations. A solution involves focusing on comparable core components of trauma-focused therapies and selecting approaches through shared decision-making to prioritize engagement and reduce treatment dropouts.\n\nThe session will conclude with vignettes that highlight instances when trauma-focused therapies elicited powerful yet surprising displays of clients' culture or spirituality thus challenging the psychiatrist to lean into the opportunity deliver more culturally relevant care.", "Overflow %": 95.5}, {"Day": "WED21", "Start Time": "13:30:00", "Title": "A.I.M for Wellness: Guiding Patients to Harness AI to Support Lifestyle Psychiatry Social Needs and Mental Health Goals", "Track Catch": "Ethics , Lifestyle Psychiatry and Medicine", "Keyword Catch": "Lifestyle Psychiatry and Medicine", "Description Catch": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming healthcare, including psychiatry. Our general session will explore AI and how it can empower patients in ways that align with lifestyle psychiatry goals, while also addressing needs reflective of unmet Social Determinants of Mental Health (SDOMH). Lifestyle psychiatry emphasizes the impact of daily habits\u2014such as diet, exercise, sleep, and stress management\u2014on mental health. Simultaneously, SDOMH\u2014factors like socioeconomic status, education, and environment\u2014significantly influence mental health outcomes. Combining AI with expert psychiatric guidance and input strongly empowers individuals to make informed decisions about lifestyle choices and unmet needs based on their unique circumstances, values, and goals. Furthermore, teaching patients how to leverage AI is a powerful approach to personalized care with enhanced patient outcomes(1). Still, AI is no magic bullet, and patients attempting to leverage AI without appropriate oversight is fraught with potential pitfalls. Without psychiatric input, AI will quickly become the new \u201cDr. Google.\u201d Patients utilizing AI without proper guidance risk encountering misinformation, breaches of data privacy, accepting questionable \u201cadvice,\u201d and misinterpretation of AI-generated content(2). This session will examine these risks and advocate for the importance of technological literacy among patients. Educating patients on the critical evaluation of AI recommendations and understanding AI's limitations is vital for maximizing benefits while minimizing harm. We will demonstrate how AI can enhance patient education and self-advocacy, offering tailored recommendations for lifestyle modifications that support mental well-being. By analyzing data from diverse sources, such as electronic health records and wearable devices, AI can generate personalized strategies for managing mental health. Participants will be asked to bring their laptops and practice using the AI to generate lifestyle recommendations in small breakout groups. Finally, using these examples, we will present practical strategies for mental health professionals to guide patients in effectively using AI tools. Through examples and case studies, we will demonstrate how AI can support self-management of mental health and lifestyle choices, promoting a collaborative model where patients and providers leverage AI as a complementary tool in mental health planning(3). Ultimately, this panel will advocate for the thoughtful integration of AI in lifestyle psychiatry and mental health care, emphasizing patient education and empowerment.

To date, more than 11,000 providers around the world have been trained in this modality. ART is efficient, relatively simple to learn, doesn't require homework, and is easier on patients and providers than traditional trauma-focused therapies. ART exploits the natural memory reconsolidation process, which is our mind's way of packaging and storing traumatic memories after they are triggered. Research shows that injecting a therapeutic intervention during memory reconsolidation can separate troubling emotions and sensations from the memories that created them. Unlike most trauma-focused therapies, which primarily aim to reduce distress, ART also aims to increase hope and joy, providing patients with feelings of relief and the resolve to tackle their issues with confidence, typically in 1-4 sessions. This seminar will review the basic science of memory reconsolidation, provide a broad overview of ART, discuss appropriate patient selection, and review ART's current evidence base.

The story garnered national attention regarding the use of restraint and seclusion in psychiatry and culminated in a feature presentation and robust discussion at the 2024 APA Annual Meeting.For decades, there have been calls to action within psychiatry, other medical specialties, and patient advocacy groups to substantially reduce or even eliminate the use of restraint and seclusion in patient care. Both practices carry significant risks of serious physical harm (including death) and psychological trauma to patients, patients\u2019 families, clinicians, trainees, and staff. Despite a national concern, and often onerous regulatory requirements regarding restraint and seclusion use, these practices remain commonplace in psychiatry. As psychiatric practice has advanced, there remains the prevailing question: What will it take to Clean the House of Psychiatry? In other words, how do we end all forms of restraint and seclusion in psychiatric patient care?  \nThis general session will establish a vision for Psychiatrists to lead a movement to reduce and eliminate restraint and seclusion by: \n-Defining the problem with restraint and seclusion use, including the risks associated with each, and racial and ethnic biases. \n-Outline the contextual drivers including workplace violence, levels of co-occurring substance use disorders, overall illness burden, jail overcrowding, as well as reduced mental health funding, lack of availability of psychiatric beds, and staffing shortages which may contribute to the actual, or perceived, need for restraint and seclusion.  \n-Review evidence-based best practices to reduce and eliminate restraint and seclusion in psychiatric hospitals.\n-Discuss approaches and challenges to disseminating the vision for eliminating restraint and seclusion, and how to support psychiatric hospitals and staff in this endeavor.\nThe use of restraint and seclusion likely perpetuates the stigma of mental illness and fuels the perception of excess use of coercive treatments by some in the psychiatric profession. Given this, as well as the highly visible social injustices that have occurred in the past few years, there are several questions that should be examined: What is the impact of the continued use of these interventions on our patients\u2019 experiences and outcomes of care? What is the \u201chidden curriculum\u201d in our training programs related to restraint and seclusion, and what new skills are needed to change it and shape the future of the profession?
