    <h1>Overflow Narrative Report – Saturday, May 17 (SAT17)</h1>

    <h2>Track Catch Interpretation</h2>
    <p>Sunday's overflow sessions reflected persistent interest in academic and clinical psychiatric practices, with notable saturation in tracks such as 'Child and Adolescent Psychiatry', 'Schizophrenia', and 'Health Equity'. These areas indicate audience alignment with vulnerable populations and the impact of social determinants.</p>

    <h2>Keyword Catch Insights</h2>
    <p>Frequent keywords included: Psychopharmacology, Psychotherapy, Practice Management, Academic Psychiatry, Lifestyle Psychiatry and Medicine, Physician Well-Being and Burnout, and others, reinforcing patterns around trauma-informed care, youth mental health, and systems-based treatment paradigms.</p>

    <h2>Description Catch Patterns</h2>
    <p>Descriptions commonly emphasized collaborative care models, trauma recovery frameworks, and the clinical utility of integrated data systems, as exemplified by: “There is universal agreement among treatment guidelines that lithium is the gold standard mood stabilizer for patients with a history of mania due to its broad spectrum of mood stabilizing properties, and its unique impact on risk of completed suicide and dementia...”, “Some wonder whether psychoanalysis and a psychodynamic perspective remain relevant in psychiatry...”, and “The general psychiatrist in the course of his work will run into forensic issues...”</p>

    <h2>Inference Summary</h2>
    <p>Overflow demand on Sunday clustered around sessions that addressed children, youth, trauma, and community mental health partnerships. Attendees appear to prioritize actionable strategies for addressing disparities, scaling trauma care, and adapting research into community contexts.</p>
