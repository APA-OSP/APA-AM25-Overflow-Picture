    <h1>Overflow Narrative Report – Saturday, May 17 (SAT17)</h1>

    <h2>Track Catch Interpretation</h2>
    <p>Monday's most overflowed sessions fell within themes of psychiatric innovation, technology in care delivery, and social justice. Popular tracks included 'Addiction Psychiatry', 'Digital Psychiatry', and 'Diversity & Health Equity'.</p>

    <h2>Keyword Catch Insights</h2>
    <p>Standout keywords included: Somatic Treatments (ECT, rTMS, DBS, etc.), Psychopharmacology, Suicide and Risk Evaluation, Women's Health, Lifestyle Psychiatry and Medicine, Biological Psychiatry and Neuropsychiatry, and others, reflecting high interest in implementation science, digitally augmented psychiatry, and community-facing intervention models.</p>

    <h2>Description Catch Patterns</h2>
    <p>Descriptions often focused on translational approaches to technology and social determinants, such as: “Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a non-invasive tool used for treating psychiatric and neurological conditions...”, “Suicide remains an all too frequent, yet often preventable,  cause of death in the United States and around the world...”, and “Physician Assisted Death (PAD) or Medical Assistance in Dying (MAID) has been legalized or decriminalized in over a dozen jurisdictions around the world...”</p>

    <h2>Inference Summary</h2>
    <p>On Monday, APA attendees strongly gravitated toward content addressing digital integration, substance use innovations, and practical strategies for equity-oriented care. Sessions demonstrating applied frameworks for delivering or scaling care in underserved populations showed notably high overflow.</p>
